<span class="subhead">TO THE AMERICAN EDITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">To write books about books has been spoken of
as though it were a parasitic industry. Undoubtedly,
books about books are among the
least necessary of books. The world delighted
in songs and epics and histories for centuries before
it paused to attend to a literary critic. Even
to-day, when men engage in the eternal discussion
of the books with which they would like to
be left on a desert island, I do not think a vote
is ever given to a volume of criticism. The poet,
the essayist, the novelist, the biographer, the
philosopher, are all safe among the world’s best
authors: the critic must be content if he is given
a place among the second-best. He is not a contributor
to the hundred best books; the most
that he can claim is that no collection of the
thousand best books would be complete without
him. Certainly, it is difficult to imagine a well-chosen
library of a thousand books without a
volume or two of literary criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span></p>

<p>This may be because a thousand supremely
good books have not yet been written—a melancholy
reflection when we think of all the ink and
paper that have been used since authorship began.
I think, however, it is also partly due to the
fact that as human society becomes civilised,
books become more and more a necessary part of
the environment of men and women, so that we
may say that on the whole it is more natural for
a civilised man to write a book about books than
a book about birds or butterflies. In a highly-developed
civilisation, literature inevitably takes
literature as part of its subject-matter as it takes
every other great human interest. Even the
historian ends by admitting authors among his
characters along with statesmen and soldiers,
and in general literature we have poems on poets,
essays on essayists, biographies of biographers,
criticisms of critics, and novels about novelists.
Writing about writers, indeed, has become in our
day an all but universal practice, and it seems to
me to stand in no more need of defence than
writing about tramps or travellers, about business-men
or burglars.</p>

<p>There is, I admit, always a danger that a
writer about writers may become excessively professional.
He may discuss writing as a cotton-manufacturer
would discuss the manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
of cotton, telling us a great deal about the
mechanism of production and nothing about the
energies, sacrifices, and personal qualities that
are the secret of genius in business as in the arts.
Criticism of this kind is important, but its place
is in a technical or professional treatise. Criticism,
in order to justify itself as a branch of
literature, must subordinate all such technical
matter to philosophy or biography, or both,—must
associate ideas about literature with ideas
about life, as Schopenhauer did, or like Sainte-Beuve
and Matthew Arnold, must portray in an
author, not only an author, but a man.</p>

<p>Those critics who write about literature as
though it were a cult for the few instead of a
normal human interest, confine themselves
largely to analysis—some of them to pretended
analysis. They do not see that the critic’s
analysis is of value only if it leads to a synthesis.
There is no use in his taking to pieces what he
sees as the genius of Shakespeare if he cannot
put it together again in such a way that it is
mirrored in the minds and imaginations of his
readers as well as in his own. It seems to me
to be the positive task of criticism to create in
one’s own mind an image of a writer’s genius
and then to try to clear the minds of one’s
readers so that the same image will be reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
in theirs. We may fail; but that, at least, is
what we are attempting to do, or what we ought
to be attempting to do.</p>

<span class="subhead">HERRICK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Herrick was a gross and good-natured clergyman
who had a double chin. He kept a pet pig,
which drank beer out of a tankard, and he and
the pig had probably a good many of the same
characteristics. It would be a libel on him to say
that he was a pig, but it would not be a libel to
say that he was a pet pig.</p>

<p>His life, like the pet pig’s, was not real, and it
certainly was not earnest. He spent the best
part of his youth mourning over the brevity
of life, and he lived till he was comfortably over
eighty. He was an Epicurean, indeed, in the
vulgar sense of the word, whose dominant theme
was the mortality of pretty things. For Herrick
gives us the feeling that for him the world was a
world of pretty things rather than of beautiful
things. He was the son of a goldsmith in Cheapside,
and himself served an apprenticeship to the
trade. The effect of this may, I think, be seen
in his verse. His spiritual home always remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
in Cheapside rather than in the Church which he
afterwards entered. He enjoyed the world as
though it were a street of shops. To read him is
to call at the florist’s and the perfumer’s and the
milliner’s and the jeweller’s and the confectioner’s
and the vintner’s and the fruiterer’s and
the toy-seller’s. If he writes, as he proclaims, of
bridegrooms and brides, he does not forget the
bride’s dress or the bride’s cake. His very vision
of Nature belittles it to the measure of “golden
Cheapside.” He begins <cite>Fair Days</cite> with the
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair was the dawn; and but e’en now the skies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Show’d like rich cream, enspir’d with strawberries.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">If he invites Phyllis to love him and live with him
in the country, he reduces the hills for her to
the size of bric-à-brac:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy feasting-tables shall be hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With daisies spread, and daffodils.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was one of those happily constituted men
who can get pleasure from most things, and it is
obvious that he got a great deal of pleasure from
his life in Devonshire, where he was Vicar of
Dean Prior, till he was ejected after the triumph
of Cromwell in the Civil War. But his heart
was never in Devonshire. There is no mirror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of Devonshire in his verse. He was a censorious
exile amid beauty of that sort, and could have
had all the flowers and country scenes he cared
for within an hour’s walk of the shop in Cheapside.
He speaks in one of his poems of “this
loathed country-life,” and in the verses called
<em>Dean-bourn, a rude River in Devon, by which
he sometimes dwelt</em>, he bids the river farewell,
and expresses the hope that he will never set
eyes on its “warty incivility” again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To my content, I never should behold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were thy streams silver, or thy rocks all gold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rocky thou art, and rocky we discover</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy men, and rocky are thy ways all over.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O men, O manners, now and ever known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be a rocky generation!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A people currish, churlish as the seas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rude almost as rudest savages.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no missing the sincere unappreciativeness
of these lines. The best that he can say of
Devon is not that it is beautiful but that he wrote
some good verses in it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">More discontents I never had</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Since I was born than here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where I have been and still am sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In this dull Devonshire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet justly too I must confess;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">I ne’er invented such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ennobled numbers for the Press</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than where I loathed so much.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been remarked that, even when he writes
of fairies, he has in mind, not the fairies of the
West Country, but the fairies he brought with
him from Ben Jonson’s London. He is rich in
the fancies of the town-poet. For him Oberon
walks through a grove “tinselled with twilight,”
and is led by the shine of snails. As for the cave
in which the Fairy King seeks Queen Mab:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">To pave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The excellency of this cave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Squirrels’ and children’s teeth late shed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are neatly here enchequered.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><cite>Oberon’s Feast</cite> again is a revel of fantastical
dishes not from nature, but from that part of
the imagination that is a toy-shop:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">A little moth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Late fattened in a piece of cloth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With withered cherries; mandrake’s ears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moles’ eyes; to these, the slain stag’s tears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unctuous dewlaps of a snail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The broke heart of a nightingale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’ercome in music.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The very titles of many of his poems seem to
have come straight from the toy-shop. How
charming some of them are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza italic">
    <div class="verse indent0">A ternary of Littles upon a pipkin of Jelly sent to a lady;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a Cherrystone sent to the tip of the Lady Jemonia Walgrave’s ear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a black Twist, rounding the Arm of the Countess of Carlisle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Julia’s Hair, bundled up in a golden net;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the Fever, not to trouble Julia;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon Lucia, dabbled in the Dew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Funeral Rites of the Rose!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Most beautiful of all, perhaps, is the title of
his most famous poem, “Gather ye rosebuds,”
which runs, <em>To the Virgins, to make much of
time</em>. Herrick’s small and delightful genius is
as manifest in the titles of his poems as in the
poems themselves. All the perfume of his verse
is in such titles as <em>To live merrily, and to trust
to Good Verses</em>; <em>To Mistress Katherine Bradshaw
the lovely, that crowned him with Laurel</em>;
<em>To the most virtuous Mistress Pot, who many
times entertained him</em>; and, especially, <em>To
Daisies, not to shut so soon</em>.</p>

<p>Herrick appears in his poetry, if we leave out
of consideration the inferior religious verse in
<cite>Noble Numbers</cite>, mainly in three characters. He
is the cheerful countryman, the praiser of his mistresses,
and the philosopher of the mortality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
pretty things. As for the first, he was too good
a disciple of Horace not to be able to play the
part cheerfully and to smile among his animals
and his beans:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">A hen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I keep, which, creaking day by day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Tells when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She goes her long white egg to lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">A lamb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I keep (tame) with my morsels fed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Whose dam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An orphan left him (lately dead) ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">A cat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I keep, that plays about my house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Grown fat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eating many a miching mouse.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">As he writes down the list, he himself realises to
what an extent his life in the country is a life of
make-believe among toys:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Which are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But toys to give my heart some ease:</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Where care</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er is, slight things do lightly please.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His mistresses are, however, a thing apart
from this happy farmyard. When he goes to
the farmyard for a simile in praise of Julia, the
effect is amusing, but it is a little lower than
love-poetry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fain would I kiss my Julia’s dainty leg,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is as white and hairless as an egg.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Some critics have doubted whether Herrick ever
was actually in love. They regard his Julias and
Antheas and Lucias as but an array of Delf
shepherdesses that every poet of the day was
expected to keep on his table. This may be true
of most of the ladies, but Julia seems real enough.
Herrick was obviously incapable of the passion
of Keats or Shelley or Browning, but we may
take it that he had been enchained and enchanted
by the lady with the black eyes and the replica
of his own double chin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Black and rolling is her eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Double-chinn’d, and forehead high;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lips she has, all ruby red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cheeks like cream enclareted;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a nose that is the grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And proscenium of her face.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is not a very attractive picture, and it is characteristic
of Herrick that he can paint Julia’s
clothes better than he can paint her face. It was
an enchained and enchanted man who wrote
those lines that are far too well known to quote
and far too charming to refrain from quoting:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whenas in silks my Julia goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The liquefaction of her clothes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next, when I cast mine eyes and see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That brave vibration each way free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O how that glittering taketh me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This is no figmentary picture. The songs to
Julia—most of all, the glorious <cite>Night Piece</cite>—are
songs of experience. Herrick may not have
loved Julia well enough to marry her, even if
she had been willing, but he loved her well enough
to write good verses. He could probably have
said farewell to any woman as philosophically as
he said farewell to sack. He was a cautious
man, and a predestined bachelor. He was, indeed,
a man of no very profound feeling. There
is no deep tide of emotion making his verse
musical. He knew love and he knew regret,
but not tragically. If he wept to see the daffodils
haste away so soon, we may be sure that he
brushed away his tears at the sound of the dinner-bell
and forgot the premature death of the
flowers in cheerful conversation with his housekeeper,
Prue. This does not mean that his
mood was insincere; it does not mean that in
<cite>To Daffodils</cite> he did not give immortal and
touching expression to one of the universal sorrows
of men. He comes nearer the grave music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of poetry here than in any of his other poems.
But the <cite lang="la">Memento mori</cite> that runs through his
verses is the <i lang="la">Memento mori</i> of a banqueter, not
of a sufferer. It is the mournfulness of a heart
that has no intention of breaking.</p>

<p>Herrick proved a true prophet in regard to
the immortality of his verse, though <cite>Hesperides</cite>
made no great stir when it was published in 1648
and seems to have made no friends among critics
till the end of the eighteenth century. But he
never gave a wiser estimate of the quality of his
work than those lines, in <cite>When he would have
his verses read</cite>, where he bids us:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In sober mornings do not thou rehearse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The holy incantation of a verse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when that men have both well drank and fed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let my enchantments then be sung or read....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the rose reigns, and locks with ointment shine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let rigid Cato read these lines of mine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This is the muse at play. It is absurd to speak of
Herrick as though he were a great lyric poet. He
is not with Shakespeare. He is not with Campion.
But he is a master of light poetry—of
poetry under the rose.</p>

<span class="subhead">VICTOR HUGO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is easy to disparage Victor Hugo, but, in
order to disparage him, it is necessary to abstain
from reading him. Take down his books and
begin to read, and, even if you do not agree with
the verdict, you will understand before long how
it was that a generation or so ago people used to
regard Victor Hugo as one of the great names
in literature. It was only Swinburne, perhaps,
who could describe him as “the greatest man born
since the death of Shakespeare,” but this did not
seem an absurd exaggeration to the majority
of readers at the time it was written, and even
a crabbed critic like Henley accepted him
as “plainly ... the greatest man of letters of
his day.” His influence as well as his reputation
was enormous and extended far beyond France.
He was a great author for the great Russians.
He was one of Dostoevsky’s favourite writers,
and <i lang="fr">Notre Dame</i> was one of the books that influenced
Tolstoy; even in his censorious old age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Tolstoy admitted <i lang="fr">Les Misérables</i> through the
strait gate of the best literature in <i>What is Art?</i>
and it seems likely, as Madame Duclaux suggests,
that it was at the back of his mind when
he wrote <i>Resurrection</i>.</p>

<p>His greatest contemporaries, however, realised
that Hugo was a charlatan as well as a man of
genius. Madame Duclaux quotes Baudelaire’s
comment, “Victor Hugo—an inspired donkey!”
and his assertion that the Almighty, “in a mood
of impenetrable mystification,” had taken genius
and silliness in equal parts in order to compound
the brain of Victor Hugo. She also quotes Balzac’s
criticism of the first night of <cite lang="fr">Les Burgraves</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story simply does not exist, the invention is
beneath contempt. But the poetry—ah, the poetry goes
to your head. It’s Titian painting his fresco on a wall
of mud. Yet there is in Victor Hugo’s plays an absence
of <em>heart</em>, which was never so conspicuous. Victor Hugo
is not <em>true</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">“Victor Hugo is not <em>true</em>.” That is the suspicion
that constantly trips one up whether one
reads his books or his life. In literature, in public
life, in private life, he was not only amazing
but an amazing humbug. We see evidence of
this in the story of his relations with his wife
and Juliette Drouet, his mistress, which Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Duclaux tells again so fairly and so well. Even
while he was pursuing the mistress across France,
he would write fervently home to the wife: “Je
t’aime! Tu es la joie et l’honneur de ma vie!”
Hugo possibly meant this when he wrote it. He
may have been lying to himself rather than to
his wife. His falseness lay in his readiness to
whisper at each shrine at which he worshipped
that this was his only shrine. At the same time,
no sooner do we admit that Hugo was an impostor
in love and in literature than we begin
to compare him with other impostors and to note
certain differences in him. His early idealism
was not merely an idealism of words. He was,
until his marriage, as chaste as his nature was
passionate. He was after marriage a faithful
husband till his wife told him that she could no
longer live with him as his wife. After he fell
in love with Juliette Drouet in 1833, we might
describe him as a high-minded bigamist, though
he did not remain perfectly faithful even in his
bigamy. One thing, at least, is certain: both
women loved him till the end of their long lives.
His dying wife wrote to him in 1868: “The end
of my dream is to die in your arms.” And, when
Juliette Drouet was slowly dying of cancer, and
both she and Hugo were between seventy and
eighty, she still insisted on nursing him at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
hint of the slightest cough or headache. “Did
he but stir, she was there with a warm drink or
an extra covering. Every morning it was she
who drew the curtains from Victor Hugo’s window,
roused the old man with a kiss on the forehead,
lit his fire, prepared the two fresh eggs
that formed his breakfast, read him the papers.”
Had he been all false, he could hardly have preserved
the affection of these two rival and devoted
women through years of danger and exile
till the ultimate triumph of his fame. Madame
Duclaux suggests, however, that he was a humbug
even on that early occasion on which, seeing
that Sainte-Beuve was in love with his wife, and
that she in turn was attracted by Sainte-Beuve
he offered with romantic generosity to let his
wife choose between them and to abide by the
result. Again, the fact that he insisted on remaining
friends with Sainte-Beuve through the
affair is regarded as evidence of his cunning
determination to keep in with the reviewers at
all costs. Victor Hugo would probably be
suspected of having been a humbug, whatever
he had done.</p>

<p>His self-importance is a continual challenge to
our belief in him. Madame Duclaux quotes
Heine’s sneer: “Hugo is worse than an egoist,
he is a Hugoist,” and his device was the arrogant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
<em>Ego Hugo</em>. But at least he had the courage of
his self-importance. In 1851, at the time of
the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i> of Louis Napoleon, when there
was a price on his head, Hugo was driving
across Paris to a meeting of the Insurrectionary
Committee, and passed a group of officers on
horseback:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The blood rushed to his head. He flung down the
window of the cab, tore his deputy’s scarf out of his
pocket, and waving it wildly, began to harangue the
General:</p>

<p>“You, who are there, dressed in the uniform of a
General, it is to you that I speak, sir. You know who
I am; I am a representative of the nation: and I know
who you are; you are a malefactor! And now do you
wish to know my name! My name is Victor Hugo!”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">This was no doubt theatrical, and both his deeds
and his words during the reign of Napoleon the
Little were those of a man consciously playing
the leading part. But the fact remains that at
this crisis he did risk everything and face
twenty years’ exile for the sake of his convictions.
The last stanza of “Ultima Verba” in
<cite lang="fr">Les Châtiments</cite> may be rhetoric, but it is not
empty rhetoric:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Si l’on n’est plus que mille, eh bien, j’en suis! Si même</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ils ne sont plus que cent, je brave encor Sylla:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">S’il en demeure dix, je serai le dixième;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et s’il n’en reste qu’un, je serai celui-là.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">There is an energy of fury in Hugo’s political
verse that keeps it alive even to-day, when Louis
Napoleon, a charlatan without this redeeming
fury, has receded into such littleness that the eye
scarcely any longer perceives him. Hugo at
times seems a painfully vocative poet—the poet,
not merely of the vocative singular, but of the
vocative plural. But there is always coursing
through his verse a great natural force, like that
of the wind or the waves, that carries us along as
we read.</p>

<p>Hugo’s work, like his life, indeed, was the
expression of what Madame Duclaux calls “a
powerful and a sensual nature, a prodigious
temperament.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His barber complained that Hugo’s beard took the
edge off any razor. At forty he cracked the kernels of
peaches with his teeth; even in his old age ... he ate
his oranges with the peel on and his lobsters in their
shell, “because he found them more digestible.” His
appetite (which was hungry, not greedy) alarmed the
good Théo. “You should see the fabulous medley he
makes on his plate of all sorts and conditions of viands:
cutlets, a salad of white beans, stewed beef and tomato
sauce, and watch him devour them, very fast, and during
a long time.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hugo is one of the forces of Nature!” cried Flaubert,
“and there circulates in his veins the sap of trees.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">This Gargantuan appetite expresses itself everywhere
in his writings. He was a Gargantua in
regard to life as well as food. He devoured the
past like the present. He devoured politics,
religion, the stage, poetry, fiction, nature, grand-children.
If he was a giant who devoured, however,
he was also a giant who created. He may
not have the accurate gift of observation on
which we set so much store nowadays, and he
may depart so far from reality as to call an
English sailor in <cite lang="fr">L’Homme qui rit</cite> Tom-Jim-Jack.
But, if he does not create for us a world
as real as Clapham Junction, he does create for
us a world as real as Æsop’s <em>Fables</em>. He is an
inventor of myths and fables, indeed. He no
more attempts to imitate the surface of life than
a musician attempts to imitate the sounds of life.
Like Dickens, he is a great Gothic writer, who
demands the right to people the work of his
hands with devil or imp or angel—with figures
of pity or horror, of laughter or tears. He does
not possess Dickens’s comic imagination; the fantastic
and the ironic take the place of humour in
his books. But his work, like that of Dickens,
is a gigantically grotesque pile built on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
ancient Christian affirmation of love. Literature
in our time may observe or ask questions: it seldom
affirms. But I doubt whether it even observes
the essential heart of things with as sure
an eye as that of Hugo or Dickens. It does not
penetrate with its pity to that underworld of
pain in which Cosette and Smike grow up,
starved and loveless. Hugo and Dickens were
at least rescuers. They were not mere sentimentalists:
they had the imaginative sympathy
that would not let them rest in the presence of
the miseries of life. They hated the tyranny of
men and the tyranny of institutions; they hated
greed and cruelty, and the iron door shut on
children and on the helpless and the suffering.</p>

<p>Hugo has dramatised this imaginative sympathy
and hatred in novels so mythical in substance
that one might easily fall into the mistake of
regarding them as false. We must think of Jean
Valjean and Javert as figures in a morality play
rather than in a psychological study if we are to
appreciate the greatness of <i lang="fr">Les Misérables</i>.
They were created, not by God, but by Victor
Hugo. But, if they have not at all points
psychological reality, they have at least legendary
reality. We can say the same of the characters
in <i lang="fr">Les Travailleurs de la mer</i> and <i lang="fr">L’Homme
qui rit</i>. They all inhabit the world, not as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
actually is, but as it is transmuted in a legendary
imagination. Unfortunately, Hugo professes
to write about real people and not about dragons,
and we constantly find ourselves applying psychological
tests as we read him. When Gilliatt
drowns himself in <i lang="fr">Les Travailleurs de la mer</i>
we complain not only of the dubious psychology
but of the mechanical theatrical effect. Victor
Hugo, we feel at such moments, was a great
“producer” rather than a great artist. He would,
undoubtedly, had he lived, have taken full advantage
of the over-emphasis of the cinema. On
the other hand, the over-emphasis of which his
critics complain is not the over-emphasis of weakness
straining after strength. It is rather an
overflow of the Gothic imagination. “His flat
foot,” he tells us, of a certain character, “was a
vulture’s claw. His skull was low at the top and
large about the temples. His ugly ears bristled
with hair, and seemed to say: ‘Beware of speaking
to the animal in this cave.’” His style is
essentially the exaggerated style. His genius is
the genius of exaggeration. Luckily, he exaggerates,
not wholly in clouds, but in carved gnomes
and all manner of fantastic detail. He omits not
a comma from his dreams and nightmares. That
is why his short sentences and paragraphs still
startle us into attention when we open one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
novels. His imagination at least teems on every
page—teems with absurdities, perhaps, as well
as with truth and beauty, but teems always with
interest. Madame Duclaux’s excellent biography
should send many readers back to the
work of this magnificent and preposterous
legend-maker and lover of his fellow-men.</p>

<span class="subhead">MOLIÈRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">The way of entertainers is hard. It is a good
enough world for those who entertain us no
higher than the ribs, but to attempt to entertain
the mind is another matter. Comedy shows men
and women (among other things) what humbugs
they are, and, as the greatest humbugs are often
persons of influence, the comic writer is naturally
hated and disparaged during his lifetime in some
of the most powerful circles. That Molière’s
body was at first refused Christian burial
may have been due to the fact that he was an
actor—in theory, an actor was not allowed even
to receive the Sacrament in those days unless he
had renounced his profession—but his profession
of comic writer had during the latter part of his
life brought him into far worse disrepute than his
profession of comic actor. He was the greatest
portrayer of those companion figures, the impostor
and the dupe, who ever lived, and, as a
result, every kind of impostor and dupe, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
religious, literary, or fashionable, was enraged
against him. That Molière was a successful
author is not disputed, but he never enjoyed a
calm and unchallenged success. He had the support
of Louis XIV and the public, but the orthodox,
the professional and the highbrow lost no
opportunity of doing him an injury.</p>

<p>Molière was nearly forty-two when he produced
<i lang="fr">L’École des Femmes</i>. He had already,
as Mr. Tilley tells us, in his solidly instructive
study, “become an assured favourite with the
public,” though <i lang="fr">Les Précieuses ridicules</i> had
given offence in the salons, and performances
were suspended for a time. With the appearance
of <i lang="fr">L’École des Femmes</i> he at length stood forth
a great writer, and the critics began to take
counsel together. A ten months’ war followed,
in the course of which he delivered two smashing
blows against his enemies, first in <i lang="fr">La Critique
de l’École des Femmes</i> and <i lang="fr">L’Impromptu de
Versailles</i>. Then “on May 12, 1664, he presented
at Versailles the first three acts of
Tartuffe.” This began a new war which lasted,
not merely ten months, but five years. It was
not until 1669 that Molière received permission
to produce in public the five-act play that we
now know. The violence of the storm the play
raised may be gauged from the quotation Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Tilley makes from Pierre Roullé’s pamphlet, in
which Roullé called Molière “un démon vêtu de
chair et habillé en homme, un libertin, un impie
digne d’un supplice exemplaire.” Mr. Shaw
himself never made people angrier than Molière.
Having held a religious hypocrite up to ridicule,
Molière went on to paint a comic portrait of a
freethinker. He gave the world <em>Dom Juan</em>,
which was a great success—for a week or two.
Suddenly, it was withdrawn, and Molière never
produced it again. Nor did he publish it. It
had apparently offended not only the clergy but
the great nobles, who disliked the exposure of
a gentleman on his way to Hell.</p>

<p>It was, we may presume, these cumulative
misfortunes that drove him into the pessimistic
mood out of which <i lang="fr">Le Misanthrope</i> was born.
He had now written three masterpieces for the
purpose of entertaining his fellows, and he was
being treated, not as a public benefactor, but as
a public enemy. One of the three had been calumniated;
one was prohibited; the third had to be
withdrawn. And, in addition to being at odds
with the world, he was at odds with his wife.
He had married her, a girl under twenty, when
he himself was forty, and she apparently remained
a coquette after marriage. One could
not ask for clearer evidence of the sanity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Molière’s genius than the fact that he was able
to make of his bitter private and public quarrels
one of the most delightful comedies in literature.
Alceste, it is true, with his desire to quit the insincere
and fashionable world and to retire into
the simple and secluded life, is said to be a study,
not of Molière himself, but of a misanthropic
nobleman. But, though Molière may have borrowed
a few features of the nobleman’s story,
he undoubtedly lent the nobleman the soul of
Molière. He had the comic vision of himself as
well as of the rest of humanity. He might mock
the vices of the world, but he could also mock
himself for hating the world, in the spirit of a
superior person, on account of its vices. He
could even, as a poet, see his wife’s point of view,
though he might quarrel with her as a husband.
Célimène, that witty and beautiful lady who refuses
to retire with Alceste into his misanthropic
solitude, has had all the world in love with her
ever since. Molière, we may be sure, sympathised
with her when she protested:</p>

<p class="center">
La solitude effraye une âme de vingt ans.
</p>

<p>Molière himself played the part of Alceste, and
his wife played Célimène. The play, we are told,
was not one of his greatest popular successes.
As one reads it, indeed, one is puzzled at times as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
to why it should be giving one such exquisite
enjoyment. There is less action in it than in any
other great play. The plot never thickens, and
the fall of the curtain leaves us with nothing
settled as to Alceste’s and Célimène’s future.
To write a comedy which is not very comic and
a drama which is not very dramatic, and to
make of this a masterpiece of comic drama, is
surely one of the most remarkable of achievements.
It can only be explained by the fact that
Molière was a great creator and not a great
mechanician. He gives the secret of life to
his people. His success in doing this is shown
by the way in which men have argued about them
ever since, as we argue about real men and
women. There are even critics who are unable
to laugh at Molière, so overwhelming is the
reality of his characters. Mr. Tilley quotes M.
Donnay as saying, “Aujourd’hui nous ne rions
pas de Tartuffe ni même d’Orgon”; and even
Mr. Tilley himself, discussing <cite lang="fr">Le Malade imaginaire</cite>,
says that we realise that Argan—Argan
of the enemas—is “at bottom a tragic
figure.” Again, he sees a “tragic element” in
the characterisation of Harpagon in <i lang="fr">L’Avare</i>,
and, speaking of Alceste in <cite lang="fr">Le Misanthrope</cite>,
he observes that, “though we may be sure that
[Molière] fully realised the tragic side of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
character, it was not this aspect that he wished
to present to the public.” It seems to me that
there is a good deal of unreality in all this. It is
as though the errors of men were too serious
things to laugh at—as though comedy had not
its own terrible wisdom and must not venture
into the depths of reality. Molière would probably
have had a short way with those who cannot
laugh at <i lang="fr">Tartuffe</i>, as Cervantes would have had
a short way with those who cannot laugh at <i lang="es">Don
Quixote</i>. There is as much imagination—as
much sympathy, even, perhaps—in the laughter
of the great comic writers as in the tears of the
sentimentalist. And Molière’s aim was laughter
achieved through an exaggerated imitation of
reality. He was the poet of good sense, and he
felt that he had but to hold up the mirror of good
sense in order that we might see how absurd is
every form of egotism and pretentiousness. He
took the side of the simple dignity of human
nature against all the narrowing vices, the anti-social
vices, whether of avarice, licentiousness,
self-righteousness or preciosity. He has written
the smiling poetry of our sins. Not that he
is indulgent to them, like Anatole France, whose
view of life is sentimental. Molière’s work was
a declaration of war against all those human
beings who are more pleased with themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
than they ought to be, down to that amazing
coterie of literary ladies in <cite lang="fr">Les Femmes savantes</cite>,
concerning whose projected academy of taste one
of them announces in almost modern accents:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nous serons par nos lois les juges des ouvrages;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Par nos lois, prose et vers, tout nous sera soumis;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nul n’aura de l’esprit hors nous et nos amis;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nous chercherons partout à trouver à redire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et ne verrons que nous qui sache bien écrire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Molière has been accused of writing an attack
on the higher education of women in <i lang="fr">Les Femmes
savantes</i>. What we see in it to-day is an immortal
picture of those intellectual impostors of
the drawing-room—the not-very-intelligentsia, as
they have been wittily called—who exist in every
civilised capital and in every generation. The
vanities of the rival poets, it is true, are caricatured
rather extravagantly, but the caricature is
essentially true to life. This is what men and
women are like. At least, this is what they are
like when they are most exclusive and most
satisfied with themselves. Molière knew human
nature. That is what makes him so much greater
a comic dramatist than any English dramatist
who has written since Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Molière has been taken to task by many critics
since his death. He has been accused even of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
writing badly. He has been accused of padding,
incorrectness, and the use of jargon. He has
been told that he should have written none of his
plays in verse, but all of them, as he wrote
<i lang="fr">L’Avare</i>, in prose. All these criticisms are
nine-tenths fatuous. Molière by the use of verse
gave comic speech the exhilaration of a game, as
Pope did, and literature that has exhilarating
qualities of this kind has justified its existence,
whether or not it squares with some hard-and-fast
theory of poetry. If we cannot define
poetry so as to leave room for Molière and Pope,
then so much the worse for our definition of
poetry. As for padding, I doubt whether any
dramatist has ever kept the breath of life in his
speech more continuously than Molière. His
dialogue is not a flowing tap but a running
stream. That Molière’s language may be faulty
I will not dispute, as French is an alien and but
half-known tongue to me. He produces his
effects, whatever his grammar. He has created
for us a world, delicious even in its insincerities
and absurdities—a world seen through charming,
humorous, generous, remorseless eyes—a world
held together by wit—a world in which the sins
of society dance to the ravishing music of the
alexandrine.</p>

<span class="subhead">EDMUND BURKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Burke, we are told, was known as “the dinner-bell”
because the House of Commons emptied
when he rose to speak. This is usually put down
to the uncouthness of his delivery. But, after all,
there was nothing in his delivery to prevent his
indictment of Warren Hastings from so affecting
his hearers in places that, as Lord Morley
writes, “every listener, including the great criminal,
held his breath in an agony of horror,” and
“women were carried out fainting.” I fancy
Burke’s virtues rather than his vices were at the
bottom of his failure in the House of Commons.
He took the imagination of an artist into politics,
and he soared high above the questions of the
hour among eternal principles of human nature
in which country gentlemen had only a very faint
interest. Not that he was a theoretical speaker
in the sense of being a doctrinaire. He had no
belief in paper Utopias. His object in politics
was not to construct an ideal society out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
head but to construct an acceptable society out
of human beings as their traditions, their environment,
and their needs have moulded them.
He never forgot that actual human beings are
the material in which the politician must work.
His constant and passionate sense of human
nature is what puts his speeches far above any
others that have been delivered in English.
Even when he spoke or wrote on the wrong side,
he was often right about human nature. Page
after page of his <i>Reflections on the French
Revolution</i> is as right about human nature as it
is wrong about its ostensible subject. One might
say with truth that, whatever his ostensible subject
may be, Burke’s real subject is always
human nature.</p>

<p>If he was indignant against wrong in America
or India or Ireland, it was not with the indignation
of a sentimentalist so much as of a moralist
outraged by the degradation of human nature.
He loved disinterestedness and wisdom in public
affairs, and he mourned over the absence of them
as a Shakespeare might have mourned over the
absence of noble characters about whom to write
plays. In his great <i>Speech at Bristol</i> he pilloried
that narrow and selfish conception of freedom
according to which freedom consists in the right
to dominate over others. Burke demanded of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
human nature not an impossible perfection but
at least the first beginnings of magnanimity.
Thus he loathed every form of mean domination,
whether it revealed itself as religious persecution
or political repression. He attacked both the
anti-Catholic and the anti-American would-be
despots in the <cite>Speech at Bristol</cite>, and his comment
may serve for almost any “anti” in any age:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is but too true that the love, and even the very idea,
of genuine liberty is extremely rare. It is but too true
that there are many whose whole scheme of freedom is
made up of pride, perverseness and insolence. They feel
themselves in a state of thraldom, they imagine that their
souls are cooped and cabined in, unless they have some
man, or some body of men, dependent on their mercy.
This desire of having some one below them descends to
those who are the very lowest of all; and a Protestant
cobbler, debased by his poverty, but exalted by his share
of the ruling Church, feels a pride in knowing it is by his
generosity alone that the peer, whose footman’s instep he
measures, is able to keep his chaplain from a jail. This
disposition is the true source of the passion which many
men in very humble life have taken to the American War.
<em>Our</em> subjects in America, <em>our</em> colonies, <em>our</em> dependants.
This lust of party-power is the liberty they hunger and
thirst for; and this syren song of ambition has charmed
ears that one would have thought were never organised
to that sort of music.</p>
</div>

<p>All through his life Burke set his face against
what may be called the lusts of human nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
As a Member of Parliament he refused to curry
favour with his constituents by gratifying their
baser appetites. In the farewell speech from
which I have quoted, he has left us an impassioned
statement of his position:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No man carries farther than I do the policy of making
government pleasing to the people. But the widest range
of this politic complaisance is confined within the limits
of justice. I would not only consult the interest of the
people, but I would cheerfully gratify their humours.
We are all a sort of children that must be soothed and
managed. I think I am not austere or formal in my
nature. I would bear, I would even myself play part
in, any innocent buffooneries to divert them. But I will
never act the tyrant for their amusement. If they will
mix malice in their sports, I shall never consent to throw
them any living, sentient creature whatsoever—no, not
so much as a kitling—to torment.</p>
</div>

<p>Burke spent the greater part of his life summoning
men to the discipline of duty and away
from anarchic graspings after rights. George
III’s war against America, as well as the French
Revolution is the assertion of a “right,” and
Burke’s hatred of the war, as of the Revolution,
arose from his belief that the assertion of “rights,”
not for great public ends, but from ill-tempered
obstinacy in clinging to a theory, was no likely
means of increasing the happiness and liberties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of human beings. He once received a letter from
a gentleman who declared that, even if the assertion
of her right to tax America meant the ruin
of England, he would nevertheless say “Let her
perish!” All through the American War Burke
saw that what prevented peace was this sort
of doctrinaire theory of the rights of England.
In 1775 the American Congress appointed a
deputation to lay a petition before the House of
Commons. The Cabinet refused to receive an
“illegal” body. Penn brought over an “olive
branch of peace” from Congress in the same
year, and again, holding fast to their theory of
the rights of Empire, ministers replied that Congress
was an illegal body. Burke saw the vital
thing to decide between England and America
was not some metaphysical point in the disputed
question of rights, but the means by which two
groups of human beings could learn to live in
peace and charity in the same world. I do not
wish to suggest that he cared nothing for the
rights or wrongs of the quarrel. He was the
impassioned champion of right, in the noble sense
of the word, beyond any other statesman of his
time. On the other hand, he detested the assertion
of a right for its own sake—the politics
born of the theory that one has the right (whether
one is a man or a nation) to do what one likes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
with one’s own. Burke saw that this is the
humour of children quarrelling in the nursery.
“The question with me is,” he said, “not whether
you have a right to render your people miserable,
but whether it is not your interest to make them
happy.” He regarded peace as almost an end
in itself, and he besought his fellow-countrymen
not to stand upon their rights at the cost of
making peace impossible. “Whether liberty be
advantageous or not,” he told them during the
war, “(for I know it is a fashion to decry the
very principle), none will dispute that peace is a
blessing; and peace must in the course of human
affairs be frequently bought by some indulgence
of liberty.” Thus we find him all through the
war reminding his fellow-countrymen that the
Americans were human beings—a fact of a kind
that is always forgotten in time of war—and
that the Anglo-American problem was chiefly a
problem in human nature. “Nobody shall persuade
me,” he declared, drawing on his knowledge
of human nature, “when a whole people are
concerned, that acts of lenity are not means of
conciliation.” Again, when he was told that
America was worth fighting for, his reply was:
“Certainly it is, if fighting a people be the best
way of gaining them.” Though opposed to the
separation of America, he was in the end convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
that, if the alternatives were separation
and coercion, England was more likely to gain
a separate America than a bludgeoned America
as a friend. Addressing his former constituents,
he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I parted with it as with a limb, but as a limb to save
the body; and I would have parted with more if more had
been necessary: anything rather than a fruitless, hopeless,
unnatural civil war. This mode of yielding would,
it is said, give way to independency without a war. I
am persuaded from the nature of things, and from every
information, that it would have had a directly contrary
effect. But if it had this effect, I confess that I should
prefer independency without war to independency with
it; and I have so much trust in the inclinations and
prejudices of mankind, and so little in anything else, that
I should expect ten times more benefit to this kingdom
from the affection of America, though under a separate
establishment, than from her perfect submission to the
Crown and Parliament, accompanied with her terror,
disgust and abhorrence. Bodies tied together by so unnatural
a bond of union as mutual hatred are only
converted to their ruin.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">There, again, you see the appeal to the “nature
of things,” the use of the imagination instead of
blind partisan passion. He himself might have
called this distinguishing quality not imagination
so much as a capacity to take long views. He
looked on the taking of long views as itself a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
primary virtue in politics. He praised Cromwell
and other statesmen whom he regarded as great
bad men because “they had long views, and
sanctified their ambition by aiming at the orderly
rule, and not the destruction of their country.”
Who, reading to-day his speeches on America
and India, can question that Burke himself
possessed the genius of the long view, which is
only another name for imagination in politics?</p>

<p>Mr. Murison’s admirable student’s edition of
some of the writings of Burke gives us examples
of Burke not only during the American but
during the French period. He has called his
book, indeed, not after the <i>Letter to the Sheriffs
of Bristol</i> or the <i>Speech at Bristol</i>, but after the
<i>Letter to a Noble Lord</i>, in which Burke defends
himself in the French period against the Duke of
Bedford. Here, as during the American War,
we find him protesting against the introduction
of “metaphysical” disputes about rights into
politics. During the American War he had said,
in regard to the question of rights: “I do not
enter into these metaphysical distinctions. I hate
the very sound of them.” Now, during the
Revolution, he declared: “Nothing can be conceived
more hard than the heart of a thoroughbred
metaphysician. It comes nearer to the cold
malignity of a wicked spirit than to the frailty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
and passion of man.” Unfortunately, Burke
himself was something of a “metaphysician” in
his attack on the French Revolution. He wrote
against France from prejudice and from theory,
and his eye is continually distracted from the
facts of human nature to a paper political orthodoxy.
Even here, however, he did not forget
human nature, and, in so far as the French
Revolution was false to human nature—if the
phrase is permissible—Burke has told the truth
in lasting prose.</p>

<p>His greatness as an artist is shown by the fact
that he can move us to silent admiration even
when we disagree with him. There is plenty of
dull matter in most of his writings, since much
of them is necessarily occupied with the detail of
dead controversies, but there is a tide of eloquence
that continually returns into his sentences
and carries us off our feet. We never get to love
him as a man. We do not know him personally
as we know Johnson. He is a voice, a figure,
not one of ourselves. His eloquence is the
eloquence of wisdom, seldom of personal intimacy.
He is not a master of tears and laughter,
but, like Milton, seems rather to represent a sort
of impassioned dignity of human nature. But
what an imagination he poured into the public
affairs of his time—an imagination to which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
time was all but indifferent until he used his
eloquence in support of (in Lord Morley’s
phrase) “the great army of the indolent good,
the people who lead excellent lives and never
use their reason.” Even then, however, the
imagination survived, and, hackneyed though it
is by quotation, one never grows weary of coming
on that great passage in which he mourns over
the fate of Marie Antoinette and the passing of
the age of chivalry from Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the
Queen of France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles;
and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly
seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her
just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the
elevated sphere she just began to move in; glittering like
the morning star, full of life, and splendour, and joy.
Oh, what a revolution! and what a heart must I have to
contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall!
Little did I dream when she added titles of veneration to
those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she
should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against
disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that
I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her
in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honour
and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must
have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look
that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry
is gone. That of sophisters, economists and calculators
has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
for ever. Never, never more, shall we behold that
generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission,
that dignified obedience, that subordination of the
heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit
of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the
cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiments
and heroic enterprise is gone! It is gone, that sensibility
of principle, that chastity of honour, which felt a
stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it
mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched,
and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing
all its grossness.</p>
</div>

<p>As we read these sentences we cease to ask
ourselves whether Burke was on the right or the
wrong side in the French Revolution. We are
content that a great artist has spoken from the
depths of his soul. He has released the truth
that is in him to the eternal enrichment of the
human race.</p>

<span class="subhead">KEATS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>1. THE VARIOUS KEATSES</h3>

<p class="in0">Most men who write in praise of Shakespeare
write in praise of themselves. Shakespeare is
their mirror. Respectable middle-aged professors
generally think of him as the respectable
middle-aged man of the Stratford bust. Mr.
Frank Harris sees him as Mr. Frank Harris with
a difference. Mr. Charles Whibley imagines him
as a Whibleyesque Tory with a knotted whip
ever ready for the back of democracy. After
reading <i>The John Keats Memorial Volume</i>, consisting
of appreciations in prose and verse from
all manner of contributors, great and little, one
comes to the conclusion that most men interpret
Keats in the same easy-going way. Thus, Mr.
Bernard Shaw notes that the poet of the <i>Ode to
a Nightingale</i> and the <i>Ode on Melancholy</i> was
“a merry soul, a jolly fellow, who could not only
carry his splendid burthen of genius, but swing
it round, toss it up and catch it again, and whistle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
a tune as he strode along,” and he discovers in
three verses of <i>The Pot of Basil</i> “the immense
indictment of the profiteers and exploiters with
which Marx has shaken capitalistic civilisation to
its foundations, even to its overthrow in Russia.”
To Dr. Arthur Lynch, on the other hand, Keats
is primarily a philosopher, whose philosophic
principles “account for his Republicanism as well
as for his criticisms of poetry.” Mr. Arthur
Symons takes an opposite view. “John Keats,”
he tells us, “at a time when the phrase had not
yet been invented, practised the theory of art for
art’s sake.... Keats had something feminine
and twisted in his mind, made up out of unhealthy
nerves ... which it is now the fashion
to call decadent.” To Sir Ian Hamilton (who
contributes a beautiful comment, saved by its
passion from the perils of high-flownness) Keats
was the prototype of the heroic youth that sacrificed
itself in the war. Did he not once declare
his willingness to “jump down Etna for any
great public good”; and did he not write:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And, if we dip into the thousands of other things
that have been written about Keats, including the
centenary appreciations, we shall find this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
personal emphasis on the part of the critic again
and again.</p>

<p>Lord Houghton even did his best to raise
Keats a step nearer in the social scale by associating
him with “the upper rank of the middle
class”—an exaggeration, however, which is no
more inaccurate than the common view that
Keats was brought up on the verge of pauperdom.
As a matter of fact, Keats’s father was an
ostler who married his employer’s daughter, and
his grandfather, the livery stable keeper of
Finsbury Pavement, left a fortune of £13,000.
But it is not only with regard to his birth that
attempts to bring Keats into the fold of respectability
are common. His character, and the character
of his genius, are unconsciously doctored
to suit the tastes of those who do not apparently
care for Keats as he actually was. The Keats
who thrashed the butcher is more important for
them than the Keats who fell in love with Fanny
Brawne. They prefer canonising Keats to
knowing him, and the logical consequence of
their attitude is that the Keats who might have
been means more to them than the Keats who
was. I do not deny that a great deal that is
said about Keats on all sides is true: possibly
most of it is true. But much of it is true only as
an argument. The manly Keats is the true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
answer to the effeminate Keats, as the effeminate
Keats is the true answer to the manly Keats.
The Keats who said: “I think I shall be among
the English poets after my death,” and the Keats
who was “snuffed out by an article” similarly
answer one another; and the Keats of <i>The Fall
of Hyperion</i> is the perfect critic of the Keats of
the <i>Ode on Indolence</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>. Keats was
a score of Keatses. He was luxurious and ascetic,
heroic and self-indulgent, ambitious and diffident,
an artist and a thinker, vulgar and an
æsthete, perfect in phrase and gauche in phrase,
melancholy and merry, sensual and spiritual, a
cynic about women and one of the great lovers,
a teller of heart-easing tales and a would-be redeemer.
The perfect portrait of Keats will
reveal him in all these contradictory lights, and
we shall never understand Keats if we merely
isolate one group of facts, such as the thrashing
of the butcher, or another group, such as that he
thought for a moment of abandoning <i>Hyperion</i>
as a result of the hostile reviews of <i>Endymion</i>.
Keats’s life was not that of a planet beautifully
poised as it wheels on its lonely errand. He was
a man torn by conflicting demons—a martyr to
poetry and love and, ultimately, to ideals of
truth and goodness.</p>

<p>He bowed before altars that, even when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
bowed, he seems to have known were altars of the
lesser gods. Not that he blasphemed the greater
gods in doing so. He believed that the altar at
the foot of the hill was a stage in the poet’s
progress to the altar at the summit. As he grew
older, however, his vision of the summit became
more intense, and a greater Muse announced to
him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">None can usurp this height</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But those to whom the miseries of the world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are miseries and will not let them rest.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">He was exchanging the worship of Apollo for the
worship of Zeus and, like Tolstoy, he seemed to
condemn his own past work as a denial of the
genius of true art. Even here, however, Keats
was still tortured by conflicting allegiances, and
it is on Apollo, not on Zeus, he calls in his condemnation
of Byron in <i>The Fall of Hyperion</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo! faded! O far-flown Apollo!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is thy misty pestilence to creep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the dwellings, through the door crannies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all mock lyrists, large self-worshippers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And careless Hectorers in proud bad verse?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though I breathe death with them it will be life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see them sprawl before me into graves.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But he was Zeus’s child, as he lay dying, and the
very epitaph he left for himself, remembering a
phrase in <i>The Maid’s Tragedy</i> of Beaumont and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Fletcher, “Here lies one whose name is writ in
water,” was a last farewell to an Apollo who
seemed to have failed him.</p>

<p>The Keats who achieved perfection in literature,
however, was Apollo’s Keats—Apollo’s and
Aphrodite’s. His odes, written out of a genius
stirred to its depths for the first time by his passion
for Fanny Brawne—he does not seem to
have been subject to love, as most poets are, in
his boyhood—were but the perfect expression of
that idolatry that had stammered in <i>Endymion</i>.
Keats in his masterpieces is still the Prince breaking
through the wood to the vision of the
Sleeping Beauty. He has not yet touched her
into life. He almost prefers to remain a
spectator, not an awakener. He loves the
picture itself more than the reality, though he
guesses all the while at the reality behind. That,
perhaps, is why men do not go to Keats for
healing, as they go to Wordsworth, or for hope,
as they go to Shelley. Keats enriches life rather
with a sense of a loveliness for ever vanishing,
and with a dream of what life might be if the
loveliness remained. Regret means more to him
than hope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who are these coming to the sacrifice?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To what green altar, O mysterious priest,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What little town by river or sea-shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, little town, thy streets for evermore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will silent be; and not a soul to tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The world at its most beautiful is for Keats a
series of dissolving pictures—of “fair attitudes”
that only the artist can make immortal. His
indolence is the indolence of a man under the
spell of beautiful shapes. His energy is the
energy of a man who would drain the whole cup
of worship in a beautiful phrase. His æsthetic
attitude to life—as æsthetic in its way as the early
Pater’s—appears in that letter in which he
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I go among the Fields and catch a glimpse of a Stoat
or a field-mouse peeping out of the withered grass—the
creature hath a purpose, and its eyes are bright with
it. I go amongst the buildings of a city, and I see a
Man hurrying along—to what? The Creature has a
purpose, and his eyes are bright with it.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">In this very letter, no doubt, the disinterested
philosopher as well as the æsthete speaks, but it is
Keats’s longing for philosophy, not his philosophy
itself, that touches us most profoundly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
in his greatest work. Our knowledge of his
sufferings gives his work a background of</p>

<p class="center">
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty’s self
</p>

<p class="in0">against which the exquisite images he wrought
have a tragic and spiritual appeal beyond that of
any other poet of his kind. The Keats we love
is more than the Keats of the poems—more even
than the Keats of the letters. It is the Keats of
these and of the life—that proud and vehement
spirit, that great-hearted traveller in the realms
of gold, caught in circumstances and done to
death in the very temples where he had
worshipped.</p>

<h3>2. THE ARTIFICER</h3>

<p>It is an interesting fact that most of the writers
who use words like artificers have been townsmen.
Milton and Gray, Keats and Lamb, were all
Londoners. It is as though to some extent words
took the place of natural scenes in the development
of the townsman’s genius. The town boy
finds the Muse in a book rather than by a stream.
He hears her voice first, perhaps, in a beautiful
phrase. It would be ridiculous to speak as
though the country-bred poet were uninfluenced
by books or the town-bred poet uninfluenced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
bird and tree, by winds and waters. All I suggest
is that in the townsman the influence of
literature is more dominant, and frequently leads
to an excitement over phrases almost more intense
than his excitement over things.</p>

<p>Milton was thus a stylist in a sense in which
Shakespeare was not. Keats was a stylist in a
sense in which Shelley was not. Not that Milton
and Keats used speech more felicitously, but they
used it more self-consciously. Theirs, at their
greatest, was the magic of art rather than of
nature. They had not, in the same measure as
Shakespeare and Shelley, the freedom of the
air—the bird-like flight or the bird-like song.</p>

<p>The genius of Keats, we know, was founded on
the reading of books. He did not even begin
writing till he was nearly eighteen, when Cowden
Clarke lent him the treasures of his library, including
<i>The Faëry Queene</i>. The first of his
great poems was written after reading Chapman’s
<i>Homer</i>, and to the end of his life he was
inspired by works of art to a greater degree than
any other writer of genius in the England of
his time.</p>

<p>This may help to explain why he was, as Mr.
John Bailey has pointed out, the poet of stillness.
Books, pictures, and Grecian urns are still. They
fix life for us in the wonder of a trance, and, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Keats saw Cortes “silent upon a peak in
Darien,” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">grey-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still as the silence round about his lair;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and figure after figure in the same sculptured
stillness, may this not have been due to the fact
that his genius fed so largely on the arts?</p>

<p>Keats, however, was the poet of trance, even
apart from his stay in the trance-world of the
artists. One of his characteristic moods was an
ecstatic indolence, like that of a man who has
tasted an enchanted herb. He was a poet, indeed,
whose soul escaped in song as on the
drowsy wings of a dream. He may be said to
have turned from the fever of life to the intoxication
of poetry. He loved poetry—“my demon
poesy”—as a thing in itself, as, perhaps, no
other poet equally great has done. This was
his quest: this was his Paradise. He prayed,
indeed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">That I may die a death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of luxury, and my young spirit follow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The morning sunbeams to the great Apollo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a fresh sacrifice; or, if I can bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The o’erwhelming sweets, ’twill bring me to the fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Visions of all places: a bowery nook</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will be elysium—an eternal book</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence I may copy many a lovely saying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">About the leaves and flowers—about the playing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was the mood in which he wrote his
greatest work. At the same time Keats was not
an unmixed æsthete. He recognised from the
first, as we see in this early poem, “Sleep and
Poetry,” that the true field of poetry is not the
joys of the senses, but the whole of human life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And can I ever bid these joys farewell?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where I may find the agonies, the strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of human hearts.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Modern critics, reading these lines, are
tempted to disparage the work Keats actually
accomplished in comparison with the work that
he might have accomplished, had he not died at
twenty-five. They prefer “The Fall of Hyperion,”
that he might have written, to “The
Eve of St. Agnes,” the “Nightingale,” and the
“Grecian Urn” that he did write. They love
the potential middle-aged Keats more than the
perfect youthful Keats.</p>

<p>This seems to me a perversity, but the criticism
has value in reminding us how rich and deep was
the nature that expressed itself in the work even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of the young Keats. Keats was an æsthete, but
he was always something more. He was a man
continually stirred by a divine hunger for things
never to be attained by the ecstasies of youth—for
knowledge, for truth, for something that
might heal the sorrows of men. His nature was
continually at war with itself. His being was in
tumult, even though his genius found its perfect
hour in stillness.</p>

<p>But it was the tumult of love, not the tumult
of noble ideals, that led to the production of his
greatest work. Fanny Brawne, that beautiful
minx in her teens, is denounced for having
murdered Keats; but she certainly did not
murder his genius. It was after meeting her
that he wrote the Odes and “The Eve of St.
Agnes,” and “Lamia” and “La Belle Dame Sans
Merci.” There has been too much cursing of
Fanny. She may have been the cause of Keats’s
greatest agony, but she was also the cause of
his greatest ecstasy. The world is in Fanny’s
debt, as Keats was. It was Fanny’s Keats, in a
very real sense, who wrote the immortal verse
that all the world now honours.</p>

<h3>3. FANNY BRAWNE</h3>

<p>“My dear Brown,” wrote the dying Keats,
with Fanny Brawne in his thoughts, in almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the last of his surviving letters, “for my sake,
be her advocate for ever.” “You think she has
many faults,” he had written a month earlier,
when leaving England; “but, for my sake, think
she has none.” Thus did Keats bequeath the
perfect image of Fanny Brawne to his friend.
And the bequest is not only to his friend but to
posterity. We, too, must study her image in the
eyes of Keats, and hang the portrait of the lady
who had no faults in at least as good a position
on the wall with those other portraits of the
flawed lady—the minx, the flirt, the siren, the
destroyer.</p>

<p>Sir Sidney Colvin, in his noble and monumental
biography of Keats, found no room for
this idealised portrait. He was scrupulously fair
to Fanny Brawne as a woman, but he condemned
her as the woman with whom Keats happened to
fall in love. To Sir Sidney she was not Keats’s
goddess, but Keats’s demon. Criticising the
book on its first appearance, I pointed out that
almost everything that is immortal in the poetry
of Keats was written when he was under the
influence of his passion for Fanny Brawne, and
I urged that, had it not been for the ploughing
and harrowing of love, we should probably never
have had the rich harvest of his genius. Sir
Sidney has now added a few pages to his preface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
in which he replies to this criticism, and declares
that to write of Fanny Brawne in such a manner
is “to misunderstand Keats’s whole career.” He
admits that “most of Keats’s best work was done
after he had met Fanny Brawne,” but it was
done, he insists, “not because of her, but in spite
of her.” “At the hour when his genius was
naturally and splendidly ripening of itself,” he
writes, “she brought into his life an element of
distracting unrest, of mingled pleasure and
torment, to use his own words, but of torment far
more than of pleasure.... In writing to her or
about her he never for a moment suggests that he
owed to her any of his inspiration as a poet....
In point of fact, from the hour when he passed
under her spell he could never do any long or
sustained work except in absence from her.”
Now all this means little more than that Fanny
Brawne made Keats suffer. On that point
everybody is agreed. The only matter in dispute
is whether this suffering was a source of energy
or of destruction to Keats’s genius.</p>

<p>Keats has left us in one of his letters his own
view of the part suffering plays in the making of
a soul. Scoffing at the conception of the world as
a “vale of tears,” he urges that we should regard
it instead as “the vale of soul-making,” and asks:
“Do you not see how necessary a world of pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and troubles is to school an intelligence and
make it a soul?” Thus, according to his own
philosophy, there is no essential contradiction
between a love that harrows and a love that
enriches. As for his never having suggested that
he owed any of his inspiration to his love for
Fanny, he may not have done this in so many
words, but he makes it clear enough that she
stirred his nature to the depths for the first time
and awakened in him that fiery energy which
is one of the first conditions of genius in poetry.
“I cannot think of you,” he wrote, “without some
sort of energy—though <i>mal à propos</i>. Even as I
leave off, it seems to me that a few more moments’
thought of you would uncrystallise and dissolve
me. I must not give way to it—but turn to my
writing again—if I fail I shall die hard. O my
love, your lips are growing sweet again to my
fancy—I must forget them.” Sir Sidney would
read this letter as a confession that love and
genius were at enmity in Keats. It seems to me
a much more reasonable view that in the heat of
conflict Keats’s genius became doubly intense,
and that, had there been no struggle, there would
have been no triumph. It is not necessary to
believe that Fanny Brawne was the ideal woman
for Keats to have loved: the point is that his love
of her was the supreme event in his life. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
never,” he told her, “felt my mind repose upon
anything with complete and undistracted enjoyment—upon
no person but you.” “I have been
astonished,” he wrote in another letter, “that men
could die martyrs for religion—I have shuddered
at it. I shudder no more—I could be martyr’d
for my religion—love is my religion—I could die
for that. I could die for you. My creed is love,
and you are its only tenet.” And still earlier
he had written: “I have two luxuries to brood
over in my walks—your loveliness and the hour
of my death. O, that I could have possession of
them both in the same minute.... I will
imagine you Venus to-night and pray, pray, pray
to your star like a heathen.” It is out of emotional
travail such as we find in these letters that
poetry is born. Is it possible to believe that,
if Keats had never fallen in love—and he had
never been in love till he met Fanny—he would
have been the great poet we know?</p>

<p>I hold that it is not. Hence I still maintain
the truth of the statement which Sir Sidney
Colvin sets out to controvert, that, while Fanny
“may have been the bad fairy of Keats as a man,
she was his good fairy as a poet.”</p>

<p>Keats’s misfortune in love was a personal
misfortune, not a misfortune to his genius. He
was too poor to marry, and, in his own phrase, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
“trembled at domestic cares.” He was ill and
morbid: he had longed for the hour of his death
before ever he set eyes on Fanny. Add to this
that he was young and sensual and as jealous as
Othello. His own nature had in it all the elements
of tragic suffering, even if Fanny had
been as perfect as St. Cecilia. And she was no
St. Cecilia. He had called her “minx” shortly
after their first meeting in the autumn of 1818,
and described her as “beautiful and elegant,
graceful, silly, fashionable and strange.” Even
then, however, he was in love with her. “The
very first week I knew you,” he told her afterwards,
“I wrote myself your vassal.... If you
should ever feel for man at the first sight what I
did for you, I am lost.” It is clear from this
that his heart and his head quarrelled about
Fanny. At the same time, after those first
censures, he never spoke critically of her again,
even to his most intimate friends. Some of his
friends evidently disliked Fanny and wished to
separate the lovers. He refers to this in a letter
in which he speaks angrily of “these laughers who
do not like you, who envy you for your beauty,”
and writes of himself as “one who, if he never
should see you again, would make you the saint
of his memory.” But Keats himself could not be
certain that she was a saint. “My greatest torment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
since I have known you,” he tells her,
“has been the fear of you being a little inclined to
the Cressid.” He is so jealous that, when he is ill,
he tells her that she must not even go into town
alone till he is well again, and says: “If you
would really what is called enjoy yourself at a
party—if you can smile in people’s faces, and
wish them to admire you <i>now</i>—you never have
nor ever will love me.” But he adds a postscript:
“No, my sweet Fanny—I am wrong—I do not
wish you to be unhappy—and yet I do, I must
while there is so sweet a beauty—my loveliest, my
darling! Good-bye! I kiss you—O the torments!”
In a later letter he returns to his jealousy,
and declares: “Hamlet’s heart was full of
such misery as mine is when he said to Ophelia,
‘Go to a nunnery, go, go!’” He tells this fragile
little worldly creature that she should be prepared
to suffer on the rack for him, accuses her
of flirting with Brown, and, in one of the most
painful of his letters, cries out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I appeal to you by the blood of that Christ you believe
in: Do not write to me if you have done anything this
month which it would have pained me to have
seen. You may have altered—if you have not—if you
still believe in dancing rooms and other societies as I
have seen you—I do not want to live—if you have done
so I wish the coming night may be my last. I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
live without you, and not only you, but <i>chaste you, virtuous
you</i>.... Be serious! Love is not a plaything—and
again do not write unless you can do it with a crystal
conscience.</p>
</div>

<p>Poor Keats! Poor Fanny! That Fanny loved
Keats is obvious. In this at least she showed
herself unworldly. She cannot have been dazzled
by his fame, for at that time he was to all appearance
merely a minor poet who had been laughed
at. He was of humble birth, and he had not even
the prospect of being able to earn a living. Add
to this that he was an all but chronic invalid. Her
love must, in the circumstances, have been a very
real and unselfish affair, and there is no evidence
to suggest that, for all her taste for dancing and
for going into town, it was fickle. Keats asked
too much of her. He wished to enslave her as she
had enslaved him. He knew in his saner moments
that he was unfair to her. “At times,” he wrote,
“I feel bitterly sorry that ever I made you unhappy.”
There was unhappiness on both sides—the
unhappiness of an engagement that could
come to nothing. “There are,” as Keats mournfully
wrote, “impossibilities in the world.” It was
Fate, not Fanny, that wrecked the life of Keats.
“My dear Brown,” he wrote near the end, “I
should have had her when I was in health, and I
should have remained well.” That is not the comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
a man makes on a woman whom he regards
as his destroying angel. Nor is it a destroying
angel that Keats pictures when he writes to
Fanny: “You are always new. The last of your
kisses was ever the sweetest; the last smile the
brightest; the last movement the gracefullest.
When you passed my window home yesterday, I
was filled with as much admiration as if I had
then seen you for the first time.” Love such as
this is not the enemy of poetry. Without it there
would be no poetry but that of patriots, saints
and hermits. A biography of Keats should not
be a biography without a heroine. That would
be <i>Hamlet</i> without Ophelia. Sir Sidney Colvin’s
is a masterly life which is likely to take a permanent
place in English biographical literature.
But it has one flaw. Sir Sidney did not see how
vital a clue Keats left us to the interpretation of
his life and genius in that last despairing appeal:
“My dear Brown, for my sake be her advocate
for ever.”</p>

<span class="subhead">CHARLES LAMB</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Charles Lamb was a small, flat-footed man whose
eyes were of different colours and who stammered.
He nevertheless leaves on many of his
readers the impression of personal beauty. De
Quincey has told us that in the repose of sleep
Lamb’s face “assumed an expression almost
seraphic, from its intellectual beauty of outline,
its childlike simplicity, and its benignity.” He
added that the eyes “disturbed the unity of effect
in Lamb’s waking face,” and gave a feeling of
restlessness, “shifting, like Northern lights,
through every mode of combination with fantastic
playfulness.” This description, I think, suggests
something of the quality of Lamb’s charm.
There are in his best work depths of repose under
a restless and prankish surface. He is at once
the most restful and the most playful of essayists.
Carlyle, whose soul could not find rest in such
quietistic virtue as Lamb’s, noticed only the playfulness
and was disgusted by it. “Charles Lamb,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
he declared, “I do verily believe to be in some
considerable degree insane. A more pitiful,
rickety, gasping, staggering, stammering tomfool
I do not know. He is witty by denying truisms
and abjuring good manners.” He wrote this in
his Diary in 1831 after paying a visit to Lamb at
Enfield. “Poor Lamb!” he concluded. “Poor
England, when such a despicable abortion is
named genius! He said: ‘There are just two
things I regret in England’s history: first, that
Guy Fawkes’ plot did not take effect (there
would have been so glorious an <i>explosion</i>); second,
that the Royalists did not hang Milton (then
we might have laughed at them), etc., etc.’
<i>Armer Teufel!</i>”</p>

<p>Carlyle would have been astonished if he had
foreseen that it would be he and not Lamb who
would be the “poor devil” in the eyes of posterity.
Lamb is a tragically lovable figure, but Carlyle is
a tragically pitiable figure. Lamb, indeed, is in
danger of being pedestalled among the saints of
literature. He had most of the virtues that a man
can have without his virtue becoming a reproach
to his fellows. He had most of the vices that a
man can have without ceasing to be virtuous. He
had enthusiasm that made him at home among the
poets, and prejudices that made him at home
among common men. His prejudices, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
were for the most part humorous, as when, speaking
of L.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L., he said: “If she belonged to me I
would lock her up and feed her on bread and
water till she left off writing poetry. A female
poet, a female author of any kind, ranks below
an actress, I think.” He also denounced clever
women as “impudent, forward, unfeminine, and
unhealthy in their minds.” At the same time, the
woman he loved most on earth and devoted his
life to was the “female author” with whom he
collaborated in the <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>. But
probably there did exist somewhere in his nature
the seeds of most of those prejudices dear to the
common Englishman—prejudices against Scotsmen,
Jews, and clever women, against such
writers as Voltaire and Shelley, and in favour of
eating, drinking and tobacco. He held some of
his prejudices comically, and some in sober
earnest, but at least he had enough of them mixed
up in his composition to keep him in touch with
ordinary people. That is one of the first necessities
of a writer—especially of a dramatist, novelist
or essayist, whose subject-matter is human
nature. A great writer may be indifferent to the
philosophy of the hour or even to some extent to
the politics of the hour, but he cannot safely be
indifferent to such matters as his neighbour’s love
of boiled ham or his fondness for a game of cards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Lamb sympathised with all the human appetites
that will bear talking about. Many noble authors
are hosts who talk gloriously, but never invite us
to dinner or even ring for the decanter. Lamb
remembers that a party should be a party.</p>

<p>It is not enough, however, that a writer should
be friends with our appetites. Lamb would
never have become the most beloved of English
essayists if he had told us only such things as that
Coleridge “holds that a man cannot have a pure
mind who refuses apple dumplings,” or that he
himself, though having lost his taste for “the
whole vegetable tribe,” sticks, nevertheless, to
asparagus, “which still seems to inspire gentle
thoughts.” He was human elsewhere than at the
table or beside a bottle. His kindness was higher
than gastric. His indulgences seem but a modest
disguise for his virtues. His life was a life of industrious
self-sacrifice. “I am wedded, Coleridge,”
he cried, after the murder of his mother,
“to the fortunes of my sister and my poor old
father”; and his life with his sister affords one of
the supreme examples of fidelity in literary
biography. Lamb is eminently the essayist of the
affections. The best of his essays are made up
of affectionate memories. He seems to steep his
very words in some dye of memory and affection
that no other writer has discovered. He is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of those rare sentimentalists who speak out of the
heart. He has but to write, “Do you remember?”
as in <i>Old China</i>, and our breasts feel a pang like
a home-sick child thinking of the happiness of a
distant fireside and a smiling mother that it will
see no more. Lamb’s work is full of this sense of
separation. He is the painter of “the old familiar
faces.” He conjures up a Utopia of the past, in
which aunts were kind and Coleridge, the “inspired
charity-boy,” was his friend, and every
neighbour was a figure as queer as a witch in a
fairy-tale. “All, all are gone”—that is his theme.</p>

<p>He is the poet of town-bred boyhood. He is a
true lover of antiquity, but antiquity means to
him, not merely such things as Oxford and a
library of old books: it means a small boy sitting
in the gallery of the theatre, and the clerks
(mostly bachelors) in the shut-up South-Sea
House, and the dead pedagogue with uplifted rod
in Christ’s Hospital, of whom he wrote: “Poor
J.&nbsp;B.! May all his faults be forgiven; and may
he be wafted to bliss by little cherub boys, all
head and wings, with no <i>bottoms</i> to reproach his
sublunary infirmities.” His essays are a jesting
elegy on all that venerable and ruined world. He
is at once Hamlet and Yorick in his melancholy
and his mirth. He has obeyed the injunction:
“Let us all praise famous men,” but he has interpreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
it in terms of the men who were famous in
his own small circle when he was a boy and a poor
clerk.</p>

<p>Lamb not only made all that world of school
and holiday and office a part of antiquity; he also
made himself a part of antiquity. He is himself
his completest character—the only character,
indeed, whom he did not paint in miniature. We
know him, as a result of his letters, his essays, and
the anecdotes of his friends, more intimately even
than we know Dr. Johnson. He has confessed
everything except his goodness, and, indeed, did
his reputation some harm with his contemporaries
by being so public with his shortcomings. He was
the enemy of dull priggishness, and would even
set up as a buffoon in contrast. He earned the
reputation of a drunkard, not entirely deserved,
partly by his <i>Confessions of a Drunkard</i>, but
partly by his habit of bursting into singing
“Diddle, diddle, dumpling,” under the influence
of liquor, whatever the company. His life, however,
was a long, half-comic battle against those
three friendly enemies of man—liquor, snuff and
tobacco. His path was strewn with good resolutions.
“This very night,” he wrote on one occasion,
“I am going to <i>leave off tobacco</i>! Surely
there must be some other world in which this unconquerable
purpose shall be realised.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
perfect anecdote of Lamb’s vices is surely that
which Hone tells of his abandonment of snuff:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One summer’s evening I was walking on Hampstead
Heath with Charles Lamb, and we talked ourselves
into a philosophic contempt of our slavery to the habit
of snuff-taking, and with the firm resolution of never
again taking a single pinch, we threw our snuff-boxes
away from the hill on which we stood, far among the
furze and the brambles below, and went home in triumph.
I began to be very miserable, and was wretched
all night. In the morning I was walking on the same
hill. I saw Charles Lamb below, searching among the
bushes. He looked up laughing, and saying, “What, you
are come to look for your snuff-box too!” “Oh, no,” said
I, taking a pinch out of a paper in my waistcoat pocket,
“I went for a halfpennyworth to the first shop that was
open.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lamb’s life is an epic of such things as this, and
Mr. Lucas is its rhapsodist. He has written an
anthological biography that will have a permanent
place on the shelves beside the works of
Lamb himself.</p>

<span class="subhead">BYRON ONCE MORE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">It will always be easy to take an interest in Byron
because he was not only a scamp but a hero—or,
alternatively, because he was not only a hero but
a scamp. As a hero he can be taken seriously: as a
villain he can be taken comically. His letters, like
<i>Don Juan</i>, reveal him at their best chiefly on the
comic side. He was not only a wit, but an audacious
wit, and there is a kind of audacity that
amuses us, whether in a guttersnipe or in a peer.
Byron was a guttersnipe in scarlet and ermine.
He enjoyed all the more playing the part of a
guttersnipe, because he could play it in a peer’s
robe. He was obviously the sort of person who,
if brought up in the gutter, would be sent to a reformatory.
Imagine a reformatory boy, unreformed
and possessed of genius, loosed on
respectable society, and you will have a picture
of Byron. Not that Byron did not share the
point of view of respectable society on the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
important matters. He had no sympathy with
the heresies of Shelley, whom he thought “crazy
against religion and morality.” He did not want
a new morality, as Shelley did: he was quite content
with the old morality and the old immorality.
He never could have run away with a woman on
principle. Love with him was not a principle,
but an appetite. He was a glutton who did not
know where to stop. He himself never pretended
that it was the desire of the moth for the star that
was the cause of his troubles. He was an orthodox
materialist, as we may gather from one of
his unusually frank letters to Lady Melbourne, a
lady in her sixties, to whom he ran with the tale
of every fresh amour, like a newsboy with the
stop-press edition of an evening paper. We find
him at the age of twenty-five or so writing to
explain that he was sure to die fairly young. “I
began very early and very violently,” he wrote,
“and alternate extremes of excess and abstinence
have utterly destroyed—oh, unsentimental word!—my
stomach, and, as Lady Oxford used seriously
to say, a broken heart means nothing but a
bad digestion.” Byron, no doubt, enjoyed posturing,
whether he exposed a broken heart or a
weak stomach. But, for a poet, he undoubtedly
lived and thought on the material plane out of all
proportion to his life and thought on the spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
plane. He felt much the same dread of a respectable
woman as did the wicked young æsthete of
the ’nineties. When he was thinking of getting
married, and had his eye on Miss Milbanke, he
wrote doubtingly to Lady Melbourne: “I admired
your niece, but she is engaged to Eden;
besides, she deserves a better heart than mine.
What shall I do—shall I advertise?” About the
same time he was writing concerning women in
general:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sadly out of practice lately; except a few sighs
to a gentlewoman at supper, who was too much occupied
with ye <i>fourth</i> wing of her <i>second</i> chicken to mind anything
that was not material.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">If the wing of a chicken was not at least as immaterial
as Byron’s sighs, there must have been
something amiss with the cooking. Byron’s sighs
to women were material enough, one fancies, to
have been visible, like a drayman’s breath on a
frosty day.</p>

<p>The letters to Lady Melbourne reveal him in
an extraordinary light, even for an amorist.
While attempting to arrange a match with Lady
Melbourne’s niece he fills the greater part of his
letter to her with the backwash of his intrigue
with her daughter-in-law, Lady Caroline Lamb,
and with stories of intrigues with various other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
ladies. Byron, like many amorists, seems never
to have realised that adventures are to the adventurous
in love as in other matters, but to have
looked on himself as a man pestered by women
when he was only a man pestered by ordinary
greed and extraordinary opportunity. If he could
not shift the blame for his sins on to the woman,
he would even shift it on to her husband. “He
literally provoked and goaded me into it,” he
wrote to Lady Melbourne, about the husband of
Lady Frances Webster, at a time when he
seemed to be falling almost seriously in love with
Lady Frances. No one who cares for scandalous
literature should miss these letters in which Byron
writes off to Lady Melbourne rapturous accounts
of every step in the wooing of the wife of his host.
“I am glad they amaze you,” he wrote to Lady
Melbourne concerning the Websters; “anything
that confirms and extends one’s observations on
life and character delights me.” It does not appear
to have occurred to him that, amazing
though the Websters were, they were but as copper
to gold compared to his own amazing self.
Lady Frances, at least, would have been considerably
amazed if she had known that, every
time she sighed, the fat young poet who adored
her heliographed the fact from Yorkshire to London.
In one of his letters he tells of a game of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
billiards with his hostess, in the course of which
he slipped a love-letter to her. Just at that moment,
“who should enter the room but the person
who ought at the moment to have been in the Red
Sea, if Satan had any civility”—in other words,
Webster, his host and her husband. Even as he is
writing the description of the incident to Lady
Melbourne, Byron makes a parenthesis to tell
her that Webster has again come into the room
(“I am this moment interrupted by the <i>Marito</i>,
and write this before him. He has brought me a
political pamphlet in MS. to decipher and applaud;
I shall content myself with the last; oh, he
is gone again”). Ultimately, however, Byron
spared Lady Frances—at least, that is how he
put it. He protested to Lady Melbourne that
he loved the lady and would have sacrificed everything
for her, and that Lady Melbourne wronged
him to think otherwise. “I hate sentiment,” he
told her, “and, in consequence, my epistolary
levity makes you believe me as hollow and heartless
as my letters are light.” The truth is, Byron
<i>was</i>, in many of his relations, heartless. He
kissed and told, and he enjoyed telling, at least,
as much as he enjoyed kissing. He tells Lady
Melbourne, for instance, about the “exquisite
oddity” of Lady Frances’s letters—“the simplicity
of her cunning and her exquisite reasons”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She vindicates her treachery to [Webster] thus: after
condemning deceit in general, and hers in particular,
she says: “But then remember it is to deceive <i>un marito</i>,
and to prevent all the unpleasant consequences, etc., etc.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear that Lady Frances, though pure,
shocked Byron, just as Byron, though impure,
shocks the average reader. She even besought
him to go on writing to her husband:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Again, she desires me to write to <i>him kindly</i>, for she
believes he cares for nobody but <i>me</i>!</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Byron could never understand unconventional
behaviour. “Is not all this a comedy?” he asks
Lady Melbourne.</p>

<p>Byron, as we read his letters and poems together,
seems to lead the double life of an actor.
There is the Byron who stands in the middle of
the stage in the fierce light that beats upon a poet,
and who declaims—how <span class="locked">gloriously!—:</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The mountains look on Marathon—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Marathon looks on the sea;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And musing there an hour alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I dreamed that Greece might still be free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For standing on the Persians’ grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could not deem myself a slave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And there is Byron behind the scenes—the Byron
who might have been invented by Mr. Shaw as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
an example of the moral irresponsibility of the
artistic temperament. It may be doubted
whether any artist of the first rank could have
written such a letter as Byron wrote to Hobhouse
in 1818, announcing that his illegitimate
daughter, Allegra, had been brought out to Italy
from England by Shelley. His reference to the
child runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shelley has got to Milan with the bastard, and its
mother; but won’t send the shild, unless I will go and
see the mother. I have sent a messenger for the shild
but I can’t leave my quarters, and have “sworn an oath.”
Between attorneys, clerks, and wives, and children, and
friends, my life is made a burthen.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Shelley, for his part, when he is writing to Byron
to ask what he is to do with the child (which has
been left on his hands month after month), never
mentions it but with a delight at least equal to
his anxiety to get rid of it. “I think,” he tells
Byron, “she is the most lovely and engaging
child I ever beheld.” Shelley’s letters to Byron
are the letters of a good man, but they are not
good letters. They are the formal utterances of
an angel. Byron’s letters, on the other hand, are
good letters, though they are not the letters of a
good man. They are the informal utterances of
a man possessed by a devil. But whether he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
as black as he painted himself it is impossible to
be sure. When little Allegra died at the age of
five, he prepared an inscription for her tomb
ending with the verse: “I shall go to her, but she
shall not return to me.” If he had been all
heartless, he could never have written his greatest
lyrics. His letters, for the most part, take us
into the comic recesses of his mind: perhaps this
comic Byron is the immortal Byron. But in
the letters, as in the legend of his death and in
his poems, there are hints of that greater Byron
whom Shelley tried to summon into being—a
Byron who would have been Byron with a touch
of Shelley—a nobler being a little more remote
from the splendour of Hell, a candidate for
Paradise.</p>

<span class="subhead">SHELLEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Matthew Arnold has had a bad time of it during
the Shelley centenary celebrations. He has been
denounced in nearly every paper in England, as
though, in his attitude to Shelley, he had shown
himself to be a malicious old nincompoop. As a
matter of fact, Matthew Arnold talked a great
deal of common sense about Shelley, and, though
he underestimated his genius, how many of the
overestimators of Shelley have even praised him
so nobly as he is praised in that unforgettable
image—“a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating
in the void his luminous wings in vain”? Yet
these are the words with which Matthew Arnold’s
critics quarrel most angrily. It is not enough
for them that he called Shelley a beautiful angel.
It is a compliment that few poets, few saints
even, have deserved. The partisans demand,
however, it seems, that he shall also be proclaimed
an effectual angel. In one sense, of course, no
great poet is ineffectual. We might as well call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
a star ineffectual. In a more limited sense, however,
a great poet who is also a theorist may be
ineffectual, and Shelley, in whom the poet and
the theorist are all but inseparable, was undoubtedly
ineffectual in this meaning of the
word.</p>

<p>He sang a philosophy of love, and one effect
of his philosophy was the suicide of Harriet
Westbrook. He was, in this instance, ineffectual
in not being able to translate his theory into
experience in such a way that what was beautiful
in theory would also be beautiful in experience.
Where a theory was concerned, he
did not recognise facts; he recognised only the
theory. Thus, his theory that love is “the sole
law which should govern the moral world”
led him in <i>Laon and Cythna</i> (later transformed
into <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>) to make the
lovers brother and sister. This circumstance
was, he declared, “intended to startle the reader
from the trance of ordinary life.” It was introduced
“merely to accustom men to that charity
and toleration which the exhibition of a practice
widely differing from their own has a tendency
to promote.” Who but an ineffectual angel
would have thought of dragging idealised incest
into a work of art solely with a view to the improvement
of his readers’ morals? He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
wish his readers to practise incest: he merely
wished to make them practise charity.</p>

<p>Shelley, indeed, was a man always hastening
towards an ideal world which at the touch of experience
turned into a mirage. His political,
like his ethical, theories had something mirage-like
about them. He was a prophet who was so
absorbed in the vision of the Promised Land that
he had little thought to spare for the human
nature that he was trying to incite to make the
journey. His own imagination travelled fast
as a ray of light, but he could not take human
beings with him on so swift a journey. Hence,
if he has been effectual, he has been so as an inspiration
to the few. He has been ineffectual as
regards achieving the earthly paradise he foretold
in <i>The Mask of Anarchy</i> and <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i>.</p>

<p>It ought, then, to be possible to appreciate
Shelley without abusing Matthew Arnold.
Every genius is limited, and we shall not admire
the genius the less but the more if we recognise
its limitations so clearly that we come to take
them for granted. Thus, if we attempt to define
Shelley’s genius as a poet, we have to start by
recognising that there is a formless quality in
most of his work when it is compared to the
work of Keats or Wordsworth. His poems do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
not seem to be quite vertebrate—to have a beginning,
a middle, and an end. Their path is
as indeterminate as the path of the lark fluttering
in the air. With Keats we stand still to survey
the earth. With Wordsworth we walk. But
Shelley, like his skylark, is a “scorner of the
ground,” and our feet do not always touch the
earth when we are in his company. Even when
he journeys by land or water, he rushes us
along as though the air were the only element,
and we are dizzied by the speed with which we
are carried from landscape to landscape. In
<i>Alastor</i>, scene succeeds scene faster than the eye
can seize it.</p>

<p>Shelley, indeed, is the poet of metamorphosis.
He loves the miraculous change from shape to
shape almost more than he loves any settled
shape. This aspect of his genius reveals itself
most richly in “The Cloud.” Here is the very
music of the changing shape. “I change, but I
cannot die,” is the cloud’s boast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For after the rain, when with never a stain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The pavilion of heaven is bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Build up the blue dome of air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And out of the caverns of rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I arise and unbuild it again.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>
<p>Shelley, too, could create these beautiful and
unsubstantial shapes from hour to hour, feeling
that each was but a new metamorphosis of universal
beauty. “The Cloud” is the divine comedy
of metamorphosis. The “Hymn of Pan” is its
tragedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">I sang of the dancing stars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I sang of the dædal Earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And of Heaven—and the giant wars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And Love, and Death, and Birth—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And then I changed my pipings—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Singing how down the vale of Menalus</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I pursued a maiden and clasped a reed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gods and men, we are all deluded thus!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All wept, as I think both ye now would,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If envy or age had not frozen your blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Here Shelley is aware of the human dissatisfaction—a
dissatisfaction that many people feel
when reading his poetry—with a life that is too
full of mirages and metamorphoses.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I pursued a maiden and clasped a reed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gods and men, we are all deluded thus!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is the confession of the ineffectual angel, who
had sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Poets are on this cold earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As chameleons might be,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hidden from their early birth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In a cave beneath the sea.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where light is, chameleons change!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where love is not, poets do:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fame is love disguised: if few</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Find either, never think it strange</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That poets range.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">For this, too, had been a song of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>This love of metamorphosis may, from one
point of view, be thought to have limited
Shelley’s genius, but it limited only to intensify.
It was this that enabled him to pass from wonderful
image to wonderful image without a pause
in that immortal procession of similes in “The
Skylark.” Every poet has this gift to some extent—the
gift by which the metamorphosis of
the thing into the image takes place—but Shelley
had it in disproportionate abundance because
the world of images meant so much more to him
than did the world of experience. Not that he
was blind to the real world, as we see from his
observation of rooks in the morning sun in “The
Euganean Hills”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So their plumes of purple grain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starred with drops of golden rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gleam above the sunlight woods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As in silent multitudes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the morning’s fitful gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the broken mist they sail.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>
<p class="in0">No naturalist could have been more accurate in
his description than this. Shelley, indeed,
claimed for himself in the preface to <i>Laon and
Cythna</i> that, in his imagery, he was essentially
and supremely a poet of experience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and
lakes and the sea, and the solitude of forests: Danger,
which sports upon the brink of precipices, has been my
playmate. I have trodden the glaciers of the Alps, and
lived under the eye of Mont Blanc. I have been a
wanderer among distant fields. I have sailed down
mighty rivers, and seen the sun rise and set, and the
stars come forth, whilst I have sailed night and day
down a rapid stream among mountains. I have seen
populous cities, and have watched the passions which
rise and spread, and sink and change, amongst assembled
multitudes of men. I have seen the theatre of the more
visible ravages of tyranny and war, and cities and villages
reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless
houses, and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon
their desolated thresholds. I have conversed with
living men of genius. The poetry of ancient Greece
and Rome, and modern Italy, and our own country, has
been to me like external nature, a passion and an enjoyment.
Such are the sources from which the materials
for the imagery of my Poem have been drawn.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">All this was true, but Shelley was too impatient
of experience to rely on it when there was a
richer world of images at hand. Images—images<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
passing into each other—meant more to
him than experience as he wrote such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My soul is an enchanted boat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float</div>

  </div>

of dreams—a world in which we walk over rainbows

<span class="subhead">PLUTARCH’S ANECDOTES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Anecdotes, like most other forms of literary
entertainment, have been spoken ill of by grave
persons, but seldom by the wise. “How superficial,”
wrote Isaac Disraeli, “is that cry of some
impertinent pretended geniuses of these times
who affect to exclaim, ‘Give me no anecdotes of
an author, but give me his works!’ I have often
found the anecdotes more interesting than the
works.” And he pointed out that “Dr. Johnson
devoted one of his periodical papers to a defence
of anecdotes.” The defence was hardly needed.
The imagination of mankind has by universal
consent paid honour to the anecdote, and Montaigne
is supreme among essayists, and Plutarch
among biographers, by virtue of anecdotes as
well as of wisdom. Plutarch himself has given
the anecdote its just praise in the opening paragraph
of his life of Alexander, when he explains:
“It is not Histories I am writing, but Lives;
and in the most illustrious deeds there is not
always a manifestation of virtue or vice—nay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
a slight thing like a phrase or a jest often makes
a greater revelation of character than battles
where thousands fell, or the greatest armaments,
or sieges of cities.” Hence the general appetite
for trifling facts about great men is not a mere
vice of gossips. It may help to preserve a detail
which will give a later man of genius a clue to a
character—the character of a man or the character
of a book. The theory that we can criticise
a poet more profoundly by leaving aside the
ordinary facts of his life as though he had never
existed in the flesh is an absurd piece of pedantry.
The life of Shelley throws a flood of light on the
poetry of Shelley. It contains in itself a profound
criticism of the genius of Shelley—a genius
that was of the air rather than of the earth—a
genius at once noble and incongruous with the
world in which men live.</p>

<p>Writers, however, may make a dozen different
uses of anecdotes. The anecdote may be anything
from a jest to an awakening touch of
portraiture, and from that to a fable that reveals
a piece of new or old truth to the imagination.
It is not open to dispute that the great writers
of anecdotes are not those who believe in anecdotes
for anecdotes’ sake. They are those who
everywhere see signs and connections, and for
whom an anecdote is a pattern in little suggesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
a pattern of life itself. Plutarch speaks of himself
as looking for “the signs of the soul in men,”
and the phrase gives some notion of the moral
and spiritual pattern into which his anecdotes
are woven.</p>

<p>I doubt if a more virtuous imagination ever
applied itself to literature. Plutarch’s unending
quest was virtue, and no illustrious man ever
sat to him for a portrait without discovering to
him virtues that he would never have revealed to
a scandalmonger such as Suetonius. It was as
though moral dignity were the chief of the
colours on Plutarch’s palette. He was fond of
contrasting his heroes with one another, but,
even when he took for heroes men who were
mortal enemies, he would penetrate deep into the
heart of each in search of some hidden or imprisoned
nobleness. He cannot paint an Alcibiades
or a Sulla as a model for children, but even
in them he seems to perceive and reverence a
greatness of spirit in ruins—some brightness of
charm or courage beyond the scope of little men.
No other writer except Shakespeare has had the
same power of setting before the imagination
characters that remain noble though undone by
great vices. To do this is, to some extent, in the
common tradition of tragedy, but there is in
Shakespeare and Plutarch a certain sweetness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
and warmth of understanding—something even
more than an enthusiasm for the best in full
view and admission of the worst—unlike anything
else in literature. It was not an accident
that Shakespeare drew so freely and so confidently
on Plutarch. The geniuses of the two
men were akin.</p>

<p>Plutarch, no doubt, was more consciously
ethical than Shakespeare, but he was ethical not
after the manner of the narrow propagandist,
but after the manner of the imaginative artist.
He does not write of model characters. He knows
that there are no perfect human beings. He recognises
the goodness in bad men, and the badness
in good men. No biographer has been more
keenly aware of the corruptibility of human nature.
Hence the characters in his Lives are real
men, with not a fault (and hardly the rumour of
a fault) hidden. He will not bear false witness
for the sake of making great men appear better
than they are. He achieves the difficult feat of
praising virtue without either canting or lying.
He is not afraid to hold the mirror up to nature
and to show us virtue fighting a doubtful battle
in a corrupt and tragic scene. He does not believe
that the virtuous man is necessarily secure
either from corruption or defeat, but he believes
that virtue itself is secure from defeat. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
recurrent theme is the Christian theme: “Fear
not them that kill the body.” He is the painter,
not only of illustrious lives, but of illustrious
deaths. He feels a spectator’s elation as he
watches a noble fifth act. He obtains from the
spectacle of virtue impavid amid the ruins an
æsthetic as well as an ethical pleasure. If any
man wishes to make a study of the æsthetics of
virtue, he will find abundant material in Plutarch.
Plutarch writes of the tragic hero as of
a man playing a fine part finely. He delights in
the moving speeches, in the very gestures. He
makes us conscious of a rhythm of nobleness
running through human life, as when he describes
the conduct of the Spartan women who fled with
Cleomenes (the quasi-Socialist king) to Egypt,
and who were murdered by their cruel hosts.
He first wins our sympathies for the wife of
Panteus, “most noble and beautiful to look
upon,” and tells us how she was but lately married
to Panteus, so that “their misfortunes came
to them in the heyday of their love.” He then
describes how this great lady behaved when she
was overtaken by death in company with the
mother and children of the king:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She it was who now took the hand of Cratesicleia as
she was led forth by the soldiers, held up her robe for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
her, and bade her be of good courage. And Cratesicleia
herself was not one whit dismayed at death, but asked
one favour only, that she might die before the children
died. However, when they were come to the place of
execution, first the children were slain before her eyes,
and then Cratesicleia herself was slain, making but one
cry at sorrows so great: “O children, whither are ye
gone?” Then the wife of Panteus, girding up her robe,
vigorous and stately woman that she was, ministered to
each of the dying women calmly and without a word,
and laid them out for burial as well as she could. And,
finally, after all were cared for, she arrayed herself, let
down her robe from about her neck, and suffering no one
besides the executioner to come near or look on her,
bravely met her end, and had no need of any one to
array or cover up her body after death. Thus her
decorum of spirit attended her in death, and she maintained
to the end that watchful care of her body which
she had set over it in life.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">That “decorum of spirit” is, for Plutarch, the
finishing grace of the noble life. And he summarises
his creed in the triumphant comment on
the Spartan women: “So then, Sparta, bringing
her women’s tragedy into emulous competition
with that of her men, showed the world that in
the last extremity Virtue cannot be outraged by
Fortune.”</p>

<p>Catholic though Plutarch is, however, in his
appreciation of virtue, and gently though he
scans his brother man—does he not forgive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
baseness of Aratus in the sentence: “I write this,
however, not with any desire to denounce Aratus,
for in many ways he was a true Greek and a
great one, but out of pity for the weakness of
human nature, which, even in characters so notably
disposed towards excellence, cannot produce
a nobility that is free from blame”?—in spite of
this imaginative understanding and sympathy,
he has himself a rigid and almost Puritanical
standard of virtue. His ideal is an ideal of temperance—of
temperance in the pleasures of the
body as well as in the love of money and the love
of glory. His Alexander the Great is a figure
of mixed passions, but he commends him most
warmly on those points on which he was temperate,
as when the beautiful wife of Dareius and
her companions fell into his hands. “But Alexander,
as it would seem,” writes Plutarch,
“considering the mastery of himself a more
kingly thing than the conquest of his enemies,
neither laid hands upon these women, nor did he
know any other before marriage, except Bersine.”
As for the other women, “displaying in rivalry
with their fair looks the beauty of his own
sobriety and self-control, he passed them by as
though they were lifeless images for display.”
Again, when Plutarch writes of the Gracchi, he
praises them as men who “scorned wealth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
were superior to money,” and, if he loves Tiberius
the better of the two, it is because he was
the more temperate and austere and could never
have been charged, as Caius was, with the innocent
extravagance of buying silver dolphins at
twelve hundred and fifty drachmas the pound.
Agis, the youthful king of Sparta, who (though
brought up amid luxury) “at once set his face
against pleasures” and attempted to banish
luxury from the State by restoring equality of
possessions, brings together in his person the
virtues that inevitably charm Plutarch. Like so
many of the old moralists, Plutarch cries out
upon riches and pleasures as the great corrupters,
and Agis, the censor of these things, comes into a
Sparta ruined by gold and silver as a beautiful
young redeemer. He dies, a blessed martyr, and
his mother, when she stands over his murdered
body, kisses his face and cries: “My son, it was
thy too great regard for others, and thy gentleness
and humanity, which have brought thee to
ruin, and us as well.” But, even here, Plutarch
does not surrender himself wholly to Agis. He
will not admit that Agis, any more than the
Gracchi, was a perfect man. “Agis,” he says,
“would seem to have taken hold of things with
too little spirit.” He “abandoned and left unfinished
the designs which he had deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
formed and announced owing to a lack of courage
due to his youth.” Plutarch’s heroes are men in
whom a god dwells at strife with a devil—the
devil of sin and imperfection. He loves them in
their inspired hour: he pities them in the hour of
their ruin. Thus he does not love men at the
expense of truth, as some preachers do, or tell
the truth about men at the expense of love, as
some cynics do. His imagination holds the reins
both of the heart and of the mind. That is the
secret of his genius as a biographer.</p>

<span class="subhead">HANS ANDERSEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Almost the last story Hans Andersen wrote was
a sentimental fable, called “The Cripple,” which
he intended as an apologia for his career as a
teller of fairy-tales. It is the story of a bed-ridden
boy, the son of a poor gardener and his
wife, who receives a story-book as a Christmas
present from his father’s master and mistress.
“He won’t get fat on that,” says the father when
he hears of so useless a gift. In the result, as was
to be expected, the book turns out to have a talismanic
effect on the fortunes of the family. It
converts the father and mother from grumblers
into figures of contentment and benevolence, so
that they look as though they had won a prize
in the lottery. It is also indirectly the cause of
little Hans recovering the use of his legs. For,
while he is lying in bed one day, he throws the
book at the cat in order to scare it away from his
bird, and, having missed his shot, he makes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
miraculous effort and leaps out of bed to prevent
disaster. Though the bird is dead, Hans is saved,
and we leave him to live happily ever afterwards
as a prospective schoolmaster. This, it must be
confessed, sounds rather like the sort of literature
that is given away as Sunday-school prizes.
One could conceive a story of the same kind being
written by the author of <i>No Gains Without
Pains</i> or <i>Jessica’s First Prayer</i>. Hans Andersen,
indeed, was in many respects more nearly
akin to the writers of tracts and moral tales than
to the folklorists. He was a teller of fairy-tales.
But he domesticated the fairy-tale and gave it
a townsman’s home. In his hands it was no
longer a courtier, as it had been in the time of
Louis XIV, or a wanderer among cottages, as it
has been at all times. There was never a teller
of fairy-tales to whom kings and queens mattered
less. He could make use of royal families in the
most charming way, as in those little satires,
“The Princess and the Pea” and “The Emperor’s
New Clothes.” But his imagination
hankered after the lives of children such as he
himself had been. He loved the poor, the ill-treated,
and the miserable, and to illuminate their
lives with all sorts of fancies. His miracles
happen preferably to those who live in poor men’s
houses. His cinder-girl seldom marries a prince:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
if she marries at all, it is usually some honest
fellow who will have to work for his living. In
Hans Andersen, however, it is the exception
rather than the rule to marry and live happily
ever afterwards. The best that even Hans the
cripple has to look forward to is being a schoolmaster.
There was never an author who took
fewer pains to give happy endings to his stories.</p>

<p>His own life was a mixture of sadness and the
vanity of success. “The Ugly Duckling” is
manifestly the fable of his autobiography. Born
into the house of a poor cobbler, he was at once
shy and ugly, and he appears to have been treated
by other children like the duckling which
“was bitten and pushed and jeered at” in the
farmyard, and upon which “the turkey-cock,
who had been born with spurs, and therefore
thought himself an emperor, blew himself up like
a ship in full sail and bore straight down.” His
father died early, and at the age of eleven Hans
ceased to go to school and was allowed to run
wild. He amused himself by devouring plays
and acting them with puppets in a toy theatre
which he had built, till at the age of eighteen he
realised that he must do something to make a
living. As he did not wish to dwindle into a
tailor, he left his home, confident that he had the
genius to succeed in Copenhagen. There his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
passion for the theatre led him to try all sorts of
occupations. He tried to write; he tried to act;
he tried to sing; he tried to dance. “He danced
figure dances,” wrote Nisbet Bain, “before the
most famous <i>danseuse</i> of the century, who not
unnaturally regarded the queer creature as an
escaped lunatic.”</p>

<p>By his persistence and his ugliness, perhaps, as
much as by the first suggestions of his genius, he
contrived at last to interest the manager of the
Royal Theatre, and, through him, the King; and
the latter had him sent off to school with a pension
to begin his education all over again in a
class of small boys. Here, one can imagine, the
“ugly duckling” had a bad time of it, and the
head master, a man with a satirical tongue, seems
to have been as merciless as the turkey-cock in
the story. Hans’s education and his unhappiness
went on till he was in his twenties, when he
escaped and tried his hand at poetry, farce,
fantasy, travel-books and fiction. We hear very
little of his novels nowadays—in England at any
rate; but we know how they were appreciated
at the time from some references in the Browning
love-letters, within a few years of their being
published. The first of them appeared in 1835,
when the author was thirty, and a few months
later an instalment of the first volume of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
fairy-tales was published. Andersen described
the latter as “fairy-tales which used to please me
when I was little and which are not known, I
think.” The book (which began with “The
Tinder-Box” and “Little Claus and Big Claus”)
was, apart from one critic, reviewed unfavourably
where it was reviewed at all. Andersen himself
appears to have been on the side of those who
thought little of it. His ambition was to write
plays and novels and epics for serious people,
and all his life he was rather rebellious against
the fame which he gradually won all over Europe
as a story-teller for children. He longed for
appreciation for works like <i>Ashuerus</i>, described
by Nisbet Bain as “an aphoristic series of historical
tableaux from the birth of Christ to the discovery
of America,” and <i>To Be or Not to Be</i>,
the last of his novels, in which he sought to
“reconcile Nature and the Bible.”</p>

<p>We are told of his vexation when a statue was
put up in Copenhagen, representing him as surrounded
by a group of children. “Not one of
the sculptors,” he declared, “seems to know that
I never <i>could</i> tell tales whenever anyone is sitting
behind me, or close up to me, still less when
I have children in my lap, or on my back, or
young Copenhageners leaning right against me.
To call me the children’s poet is a mere figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of speech. My aim has always been to be the
poet of older people of all sorts: children alone
cannot represent me.” It is possible, however,
that Andersen rather enjoyed taking up a
grumpy pose in regard to his stories for children.
In any case he continued to publish fresh series
of them until 1872, three years before his death.
He also enjoyed the enthusiastic reception their
popularity brought him during his frequent
travels in most of the countries of Europe between
England and Turkey. Nor did he object
to turning himself into a story-teller at a children’s
party. There is a description in one of
Henry James’s books of such a party at Rome,
at which Hans Andersen read “The Ugly Duckling”
and Browning “The Pied Piper of
Hamelin,” followed by “a grand march through
the spacious Barberini apartment, with [W.&nbsp;W.]
Story doing his best on a flute in default of
bagpipes.” Nor does Andersen seem to have
thought too disrespectfully of his fairy-tales
when he wrote “The Cripple.”</p>

<p>Probably, however, even in his fairy-tales
Hans Andersen has always appealed to men and
women as strongly as to children. We hear
occasionally of children who cannot be reconciled
to him because of his incurable habit of pathos.
A child can read a fairy-tale like “The Sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Beauty” as if it were playing among toys, but
it cannot read “The Marsh King’s Daughter”
without enacting in its own soul the pathetic
adventures of the frog-girl; it cannot read “The
Snow Queen” without enduring all the sorrows
of Gerda as she travels in search of her lost
friend; it cannot read “The Little Mermaid”
without feeling as if the knives were piercing its
feet just as the mermaid felt when she got her
wish to become a human being so that she might
possess a soul. Even in “The Wild Swans,”
though Lisa’s eleven brothers are all restored
to humanity from the shapes into which their
wicked step-mother had put them, it is only
after a series of harrowing incidents; and Lisa
herself has to be rescued from being burned as
a witch. Hans Andersen is surely the least gay
of all writers for children. He does not invent
exquisite confectionery for the nursery such as
Charles Perrault, having heard a nurse telling
the stories to his little son, gave the world in
“Cinderella” and “Bluebeard.” To read stories
like these is to enter into a game of make-believe,
no more to be taken seriously than a charade.
The Chinese lanterns of a happy ending seem to
illuminate them all the way through. But Hans
Andersen does not invite you to a charade. He
invites you to put yourself in the place of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
little match-girl who is frozen to death in the
snow on New Year’s Eve after burning her
matches and pretending that she is enjoying all
the delights of Christmas. He is more like a
child’s Dickens than a successor of the ladies
and gentlemen who wrote fairy-tales in the age
of Louis XIV and Louis XV. He is like
Dickens, indeed, not only in his genius for compassion,
but in his abounding inventiveness, his
grotesque detail, and his humour. He is never
so recklessly cheerful as Dickens with the cheerfulness
that suggests eating and drinking. He
makes us smile rather than laugh aloud with his
comedy. But how delightful is the fun at the
end of “Soup on a Sausage Peg” when the Mouse
King learns that the only way in which the soup
can be made is by stirring a pot of boiling water
with his own tail! And what child does not love
in all its bones the cunning in “Little Claus and
Big Claus,” when Big Claus is tricked into killing
his horses, murdering his grandmother, and
finally allowing himself to be tied in a sack and
thrown into the river?</p>

<p>But Hans Andersen was too urgent a moralist
to be content to write stories so immorally amusing
as this. He was as anxious as a preacher or
a parent or Dickens to see children Christians of
sorts, and he used the fairy-tale continually as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
means of teaching and warning them. In one
story he makes the storks decide to punish an
ugly boy who had been cruel to them. “There
is a little dead child in the pond, one that has
dreamed itself to death; we will bring that for
him. Then he will cry because we have brought
him a little dead brother.” That is certainly
rather harsh. “The Girl Who Trod on the
Loaf” is equally severe. As a result of her
cruelty in tearing flies’ wings off and her wastefulness
in using a good loaf as a stepping-stone,
she sinks down through the mud into Hell, where
she is tormented with flies that crawl over her
eyes, and having had their wings pulled out, cannot
fly away. Hans Andersen, however, like
Ibsen in <i>Peer Gynt</i>, believes in redemption
through the love of others, and even the girl who
trod on the loaf is ultimately saved. “Love begets
life” runs like a text through “The Marsh
King’s Daughter.” His stories as a whole are
an imaginative representation of that gospel—a
gospel that so easily becomes mush and platitude
in ordinary hands. But Andersen’s genius
as a narrator, as a grotesque inventor of incident
and comic detail, saves his gospel from commonness.
He may write a parable about a darning-needle,
but he succeeds in making his
darning-needle alive, like a dog or a schoolboy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
He endows everything he sees—china shepherdesses,
tin soldiers, mice and flowers—with the
similitude of life, action and conversation. He
can make the inhabitants of one’s mantelpiece
capable of epic adventures, and has a greater
sense of possibilities in a pair of tongs or a
door-knocker than most of us have in men and
women. He is a creator of a thousand fancies.
He loves imagining elves no higher than a
mouse’s knee, and mice going on their travels
leaning on sausage-skewers as pilgrims’ staves,
and little Thumbelina, whose cradle was “a neat
polished walnut-shell ... blue violet-leaves
were her mattresses, with a rose-leaf for a coverlet.”
His fancy never becomes lyrical or sweeps
us off our feet, like Shakespeare’s in <i>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>. But there was nothing
else like it in the fairy-tale literature of the nineteenth
century. And his pages are full of the
poetry of flights of birds. More than anything
else one thinks of Hans Andersen as a lonely
child watching a flight of swans or storks till it
is lost to view, silent and full of wonder and
sadness. Mr. Edmund Gosse, in <i>Two Visits to
Denmark</i>, a book in which everything is interesting
except the title, describes a visit which he
paid to Hans Andersen at Copenhagen in his
old age, when “he took me out into the balcony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and bade me notice the long caravan of ships
going by in the Sound below—‘they are like a
flock of wild swans’ he said.” The image might
have occurred to anyone, but it is specially interesting
as coming from the mouth of Hans
Andersen, because it seems to express so much
of his vision of the world. He was, above all
men of his century, the magician of the flock of
wild swans.</p>

<span class="subhead">JOHN CLARE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Arthur Symons edited a good selection of
the poems of John Clare a few years ago, and
Edward Thomas was always faithful in his
praise. Yet Messrs. Blunden &amp; Porter’s new
edition of Clare’s work has meant for most of its
readers the rediscovery of a lost man of genius.
For Clare, though he enjoyed a “boom” in London
almost exactly a hundred years ago, has
never been fully appreciated: he has never even
been fully printed. In 1820 he was more famous
than Keats, who had the same publisher. Keats’s
1820 volume was one of the great books of English
literature, but the public preferred John
Clare, and three editions of <i>Poems Descriptive of
Rural Life and Scenery</i> were sold between January
16 and the end of March. It was not that
the public had discovered a poet: it was merely
that they had discovered an agricultural labourer
who was a poet. At the same time, to have been
over-boomed was bound to do Clare’s reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
harm. It raised hopes that his verse did not
satisfy, and readers who come to an author expecting
too much are apt in their disappointment
to blame him for even more faults than he
possesses. It is obvious that if we are asked to
appreciate Clare as a poet of the same company
as Keats and Shelley, our minds will be preoccupied
with the feeling that he is an intruder,
and we shall be able to listen to him with all our
attention only when he has ceased to challenge
such ruinous comparisons. I do not know
whether the critics of 1820 gave more praise to
Clare than to Keats. But the public did. The
public blew a bubble, and the bubble burst. Had
Clare, instead of making a sensation, merely
made the quiet reputation he deserved, he would
not have collapsed so soon into one of the most
unjustly neglected poets of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate Clare, we have to begin
by admitting that he never wrote either a great
or a perfect poem. He never wrote a “Tintern
Abbey” or a “Skylark” or a “Grecian Urn” or
a “Tiger” or a “Red, Red Rose” or an “Ode to
Evening.” He was not a great artist uttering
the final rhythms and the final sentences—rhythms
and sentences so perfect that they seem
like existences that have escaped out of eternity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
His place in literature is nearer that of Gilbert
White or Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Hudson than that of
Shelley. His poetry is a mirror of things rather
than a window of the imagination. It belongs
to a borderland where naturalism and literature
meet. He brings things seen before our eyes:
the record of his senses is more important than
the record of his imagination or his thoughts.
He was an observer whose consuming delight was
to watch—to watch a grasshopper or a snail, a
thistle or a yellow-hammer. The things that a
Wordsworth or a Shelley sees or hears open the
door, as it were, to still more wonderful things
that the poet has not seen or heard. Shelley hears
a skylark, and it becomes not only a skylark,
but a flight of images, illumining the mysteries
of life as they pass. Wordsworth hears a Highland
girl singing, and her song becomes not only
a girl’s song, but the secret music of far times
and far places, brimming over and filling the
world. To Clare the skylark was most wonderful
as a thing seen and noticed: it was the end,
not the beginning, of wonders. He may be led
by real things to a train of reflections: he is never
at his best led to a train of images. His realism,
however, is often steeped in the pathos of memory,
and it is largely this that changes his naturalism
into poetry. One of the most beautiful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
his poems is called “Remembrances,” and who
that has read it can ever forget the moving verse
in which Clare calls up the playtime of his boyhood
and compares it with a world in which men
have begun to hang dead moles on trees?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When from school o’er Little Field with its brook and wooden brig,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where I swaggered like a man though I was not half so big,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While I held my little plough though ’twas but a willow twig,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And drove my team along made of nothing but a name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gee hep” and “hoit” and “woi”—O I never call to mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These pleasant names of places but I leave a sigh behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While I see little mouldiwarps hang sweeing to the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the only aged willow that in all the field remains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And nature hides her face while they’re sweeing in their chains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in a silent murmuring complains.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The pity that we find in this poem is, perhaps,
the dominant emotion in Clare’s work. Helpless
living things made the strongest appeal to him,
and he honoured the spear-thistle, as it had never
been honoured in poetry before, chiefly because
of the protection it gave to the nesting partridge
and the lark. In “Spear Thistle,” after describing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the partridge, which will lie down in a
thistle-clump,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">and dust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prune its horse-shoe circled breast,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">he continues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sheep when hunger presses sore</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">May nip the clover round its nest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon the thistle wounding sore</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Relieves it from each brushing guest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That leaves a bit of wool behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The yellow-hammer loves to find.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The horse will set his foot and bite</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Close to the ground lark’s guarded nest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And snort to meet the prickly sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He fans the feathers of her breast—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet thistles prick so deep that he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turns back and leaves her dwelling free.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have only to compare the detail of Clare’s
work with the sonorous generalisations in, say,
Thomson’s <i>Seasons</i>—which he admired—to realise
the immense gulf that divides Clare from
his eighteenth-century predecessors. Clare, indeed,
is more like a twentieth-century than an
eighteenth-century poet. He is almost more
like a twentieth-century than a nineteenth-century
poet. He is “neo-Georgian” in his preference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
for the fact in itself above the image or the
phrase. The thing itself is all the image he asks,
and Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Davies in his simplest mood
might have made the same confession of faith as
Clare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I love the verse that mild and bland</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Breathes of green fields and open sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I love the muse that in her hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bears flowers of native poesy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who walks nor skips the pasture brook</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In scorn, but by the drinking horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leans o’er its little brig to look</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How far the sallows lean across.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no poet, I fancy, in whose work the
phrase, “I love,” recurs oftener. His poetry is
largely a list of the things he loves:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I love at early morn, from new-mown swath</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see the startled frog his route pursue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mark while, leaping o’er the dripping path,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His bright sides scatter dew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The early lark that from its bustle flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To hail his matin new;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And watch him to the skies:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With earnest heed and tremulous intent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Frail brother of the morn,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That from the tiny bents and misted leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Withdraws his timid horn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And fearful visions weaves.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we read Clare we discover that it is almost
always the little things that catch his eye:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Grasshoppers go in many a thrumming spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now to stalks of tasselled sow-grass cling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That shakes and swees awhile, but still keeps straight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While arching ox-eye doubles with his weight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next on the cat-tail grass with farther bound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He springs, that bends until they touch the ground.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He is never weary of describing the bees. He
praises the ants. Of the birds, he seems to love
the small ones best. How beautifully he writes
of the hedge-sparrow’s little song!:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While in a quiet mood hedge-sparrows try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An inward stir of shadowed melody.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is the genius of a lover in this description.
Here is something finally said. Clare
continually labours to make the report of his
eye and ear accurate. He even begins one of his
<i>Asylum Poems</i> with the line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet chestnuts brown like soling leather turn;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and, in another, pursues realism in describing an
April evening to the point of writing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sheep ointment seems to daub the dead-hued sky.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>
<p class="in0">His attempt at giving an exact echo of the blue-tit’s
song—his very feeble attempt—makes the
success of one of his good poems tremble for a
moment in the balance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dreamers, mark the honey bee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Mark the tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the blue cap “<i>tootle tee</i>”</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Sings a glee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sung to Adam and to Eve—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Here they be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When floods covered every bough,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Noah’s ark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heard that ballad singing now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Hark, hark.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Tootle, tootle, tootle tee</i>”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Can it be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pride and fame must shadows be?</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Come and see—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every season owns her own;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Bird and bee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sing creation’s music on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Nature’s glee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is in every mood and tone</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Eternity.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Clare comes nearer an imaginative vision of life
in this than in most of his poems. But, where
Shelley would have given us an image, Clare is
content to set down “<i>Tootle, tootle, tootle tee</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>His poems of human life are of less account
than his poems of bird and insect life; but one of
the most beautiful of all his poems, “The Dying
Child,” introduces a human figure among the
bees and flowers. How moving are the first three
verses!:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He could not die when trees were green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For he loved the time too well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His little hands, when flowers were seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were held for the bluebell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he was carried o’er the green.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His eye glanced at the white-nosed bee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He knew those children of the spring:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he was well and on the lea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He held one in his hands to sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which filled his heart with glee.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Infants, the children of the spring!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How can an infant die</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When butterflies are on the wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Green grass, and such a sky?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How can they die at spring?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The writer of these lines was a poet worth rediscovering,
and Messrs. Blunden and Porter
have given us a book in which we can wander at
will, peering into hedges and at the traffic of the
grass, as in few even of the great poets. Mr.
Blunden has also written an admirable, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
needlessly pugnacious account of the life of
The Green Man, as Clare was called in Lamb’s
circle because of his clothes. It is a story of
struggle, poverty, drink, a moment’s fame without
money to correspond, a long family, and the
madness of a man who, escaping from the asylum,
ate “the grass on the roadside which seemed to
taste something like bread.” Knowing the events
of his life, we read Clare’s poetry with all the
more intense curiosity. And, if we do not expect
to find a Blake or a Wordsworth, we shall
not be disappointed. Certainly this is a book
that must go on the shelf near the works of Mr.
Hudson.</p>

<span class="subhead">HISTORIANS AS ENTERTAINERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Herodotus is one of the oldest illustrations of
the fact that a test of good literature is its capacity
to entertain us. There are two sorts of
writing—the entertaining and the dull—and the
dull is outside literature. This is a fact which,
though it is perfectly obvious, tends to be forgotten
by many writers, even by many able
writers, in every century. Authors fall in love
with their own ponderosity, forgetting that a
huge tome is too often a huge tomb. That is the
explanation of the long lives and the still longer
histories that the publishers and the authors of
the nineteenth century loved. Biographies became
life-size, and histories rivalled in length
the wars they chronicled. A Victorian biographer
appeared to think that he was performing
more ambitious work in writing a life of Milton
in six volumes than if he were to write it in one.
Similarly, a historian instead of giving us a
Cromwell that the eye could take in as one absorbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
figure, would devote one volume to this
bit of him and another to that, and would leave
us with a mass of information about his <i>disjecta
membra</i>, which we might or might not piece together,
just as we pleased. This was called
scientific history. Its disciples forgot that history
is an art and that, like all other arts, whatever its
ultimate object, it should be subject to the law
of entertainment. Nothing else will keep history
alive, except as a schoolbook or a source-book.
An inaccurate history that entertains will outlive
an accurate history that wearies. Herodotus
did not cease to be read, even when he was generally
regarded as the father of lies. It is true that
scholars no longer regard him as a liar, and that
Mr. Godley, in the preface to his admirable
translation in the Loeb Library, claims with Dr.
Macan that “the most stringent application of
historical and critical methods to the text of
Herodotus leaves the work irrevocably and irreplaceably
at the head of European prose literature,
whether in its scientific or in its artistic
character.” At the same time, even if we did not
know about the scientific value of Herodotus, his
artistic value would be indisputable. He was as
indefatigably interested in the world as Mr.
Pepys was in himself, and he can infect us with
the thrill of his delightful curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Curiosity, on the other hand, implies interest
in some sort of truth, and the pursuit of some
sort of truth seems to be an essential in a book
that is to entertain us permanently. The artist
is moralist as well as entertainer, and the truth
that lies in him shapes his work, whether he is
Æschylus or Plato, Herodotus or Sallust. Sallust’s
<i>Jugurtha</i>, Professor Rolfe warns us in a
preface to the Loeb translation, “is rather like a
historical novel of the better class than like sober
history” and the <i>Cataline</i>, we are told, “is inaccurate
in many of its details ... with inevitable
distortion of the facts.” Even so, both works
are entertaining statements of a great moral idea—the
idea of the corruption of human nature by
success. Sallust, it may be argued, had the
propagandist purpose of attacking the corruption
of the nobles rather than the moral purpose
of exhibiting the corruption of human nature, but
he writes his history with an amazing dramatic
sense of the catastrophe that occurs even in great
souls. It occurred in the soul of Jugurtha, and
in the soul of Rome. “When Carthage, the rival
of Rome’s sway, had perished root and branch,
and all seas and lands were open, then Fortune
began to grow cruel and to bring confusion into
all our affairs. Those who had found it easy to
bear hardship and dangers, anxiety and adversity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
found leisure and wealth, desirable under
other circumstances, a burden and a curse.
Hence the lust for power, then for money, grew
upon them; these were, I may say, the root of
all evils.” What is all literature but the fable of
such things? It may be an inspiring fable or a
derisive fable, a tragic fable or a comic fable,
but in any event it cannot be good literature
unless it is an entertaining fable.</p>

<p>Herodotus, certainly, never forgets for long
that history is a fable. That wonderful anecdote
of Gyges and the infatuated King who compelled
him to hide behind the door and to look on the
Queen when she was naked, with the result that
the Queen on discovering him, ordered him to
kill the King and marry her or die himself, is not
a mere unrelated scene as from a ballet, but has
its tragic signature five generations later, when
the power of Crœsus, the descendant of Gyges,
is destroyed and he is a prisoner in the camp of
Cyrus. Crœsus, being unable to understand how
the disaster had happened, obtained permission
from Cyrus to send messengers to Delphi to enquire
of the Oracle why it had deceived him.
And the priestess replied: “None may escape
his destined lot, not even a god. Crœsus hath
paid for the sin of his ancestor of the fifth generation:
who, being of the guard of the Heraclidæ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
was led by the guile of a woman to slay his master,
and took to himself the royal state of that
master, whereto he had no right.” We find
in pagan literature a sense of the divine government
of the world that is missing from the greater
part of modern Christian literature. The pagan
historians, I think, have a profounder sense of
sin and of the sufferings that result from sin than
most of the Christian historians. Nowadays, we
hesitate before allowing even Richard III or
Judge Jeffreys to have been a sinner. And, as
we have found no substitute for those ancient
colours of vice and virtue, much of our history is
colourless and uninteresting. The sense of sin
is of infinite value to an artist, if only because
it enables him to see how striking are the contrasts
that exist in every human being. He sees
the great man as a miserable sinner, and he sees
him all the more truthfully for this. He sees the
beautiful woman as a miserable sinner, and he
sees her all the more truthfully for this. Aristotle,
indeed, thought that it was impossible to write
great tragic literature except about a noble
character who was seen to be a sinner. It was
probably never done till the appearance of the
Gospels, and I am not sure whether it has been
done since. Shakespeare had as compassionate
a sense of the flaw in human nature even at its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
greatest as the Greek dramatists and the supreme
Greek biographer.</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, a school of writers who have
so keen a sense of the flaws that they can see
scarcely anything else. This is inimical to art.
Suetonius provides us with a feast of flaws, from
which we rise with the feeling that we have been
dining on spiced and putrid dishes. His was
not a disinterested observation of human character.
He was a specialist in the vices. It is appalling
to think what he would have made of
Sempronia, one of the many Roman ladies whom
Catiline enticed into his conspiracy. Sallust’s
portrait of her is a masterpiece:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now among these women was Sempronia, who had
often committed many crimes of masculine daring.
In birth and beauty, in her husband and children, she
was abundantly favoured by fortune; well read in the
literature of Greece and Rome, able to play the lyre and
dance more skilfully than an honest woman need, and
having many other accomplishments which minister to
voluptuousness. But there was nothing which she held
so cheap as modesty and chastity; you could not easily
say whether she was less sparing of her money or her
honour; her desires were so ardent that she sought men
more often than she was sought by them. Even before
the time of the conspiracy, she had often broken her
word, repudiated her debts, been privy to murder;
poverty and extravagance combined had driven her headlong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Nevertheless, she was a woman of no mean
endowments; she could write verses, bandy jests, and use
language which was modest, or tender, or wanton; in
fine, she possessed a high degree of wit and charm.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">A miserable sinner, undoubtedly. How odious
and how interesting!</p>

<p>But, even as gossips, how these ancient historians
still keep their hold on us! Herodotus is
the father of nursery tales as well as of moral
tales. His account of Egypt in the second book
of his history may appeal to the anthropologist in
some of us; it also appeals to the child in all of
us. He must have omitted thousands of the
stories that he heard on his travels, but he had a
genius for finding room for the interesting story.
His pages are rich in attractive stories like that
which tells how Psammetichus decided whether
the Egyptians or the Phrygians were the oldest
nation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now before Psammetichus became king of Egypt, the
Egyptians deemed themselves to be the oldest nation on
earth.... Psammetichus, being nowise able to discover
by enquiry what men had first come into being, devised
a plan whereby he took two new-born children of common
men and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among
his flock. He gave charge that none should speak any
word in their hearing; they were to lie by themselves in a
lonely hut, and in due season the shepherd was to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
goats and give the children their milk and do all else
needful. Psammetichus did this, and gave this charge,
because he desired to hear what speech would first break
from the children, when they were past the age of indistinct
babbling. And he had his wish; for, when the
shepherd had done as he was bidden for two years, one
day as he opened the door and entered, both the children
ran to him, stretching out their hands and calling
“Bekos.” When he first heard this he said nothing of it;
but coming often and taking careful note, he was ever
hearing this same word, till at last he told the matter to
his master, and on command brought the children into
the King’s presence. Psammetichus heard them himself,
and enquired to what language this word “Bekos” might
belong; he found it to be a Phrygian word signifying
bread. Reasoning from this fact the Egyptians confessed
that the Phrygians were older than they.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Scientific? Perhaps not. And yet science and
art may embrace in the recording of such
stories as this. But it is in the museum of the
arts, not in that of the sciences, that Herodotus
holds his immortal place. He may not be the
first of the scientific historians: he is certainly the
first of the European masters of the art of entertaining
prose.</p>

<span class="subhead">A WORDSWORTH DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">A good many people were pleased—not without
malice—when Professor Harper discovered a
few years ago that Wordsworth had an illegitimate
daughter. It was like hearing a piece of
scandal about an archbishop. As a matter of
fact, the story, as Professor Harper tells it, is
not a scandal; it is merely a puzzle. The figures
in the episode are names and shadows: we know
almost nothing as regards their feelings for each
other or what it was that prevented the lovers
from marrying. Professor Harper believes that
Wordsworth has left a disguised version of the
story in <i>Vaudracour and Julia</i>. Wordsworth
himself says of <i>Vaudracour and Julia</i> that “the
facts are true,” and the main “facts” in the poem
are that the lovers wish to marry, cannot gain
their parent’s consent, and give way to passion,
and that after this their parents, instead of
softening in their attitude, insist more harshly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
than ever on keeping them apart. Wordsworth
is vehement in his contention that Vaudracour
was no common seducer yielding to the lusts of
the flesh, and the suggestion is fairly clear that
the youth thought he was taking the only way to
make marriage inevitable. Consider these lines,
which impute honourable motives, if not honourable
conduct, to the lover:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So passed the time, till whether through effect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of some unguarded moment that dissolved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Virtuous restraint—ah, speak it, think it, not!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deem rather that the fervent youth, who saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So many bars between his present state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the dear haven where he wished to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In honourable wedlock with his love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was in his judgment tempted to decline</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To perilous weakness, and entrust his cause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To nature for a happy end of all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deem that by such fond hope the youth was swayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bear with their transgression, when I add</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Carried about her for a secret grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The promise of a mother.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">These lines have an ethical rather than a poetical
interest. Whether Wordsworth, in writing them,
was consciously or subconsciously attempting
his own moral justification, we do not know. But
Professor Harper has collected a number of facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
that make it appear likely that he was. Certainly,
the story of Wordsworth and Marie-Anne
Vallon at Orleans in 1792, so far as we know it,
might without violence be dramatised as the story
of Vaudracour and Julia.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, for example, the “many bars”
that stood in the way of Wordsworth’s marriage
to Marie-Anne, or “Annette,” Vallon. They
were not, as in the poem, barriers of class, but
they were the equally insurmountable barriers of
creed, both political and religious. Wordsworth
was a young Englishman, full of the
ardour of the Revolution, and a Protestant of so
sceptical a cast that Coleridge described him as
a “semi-atheist.” Annette, for her part, was the
child of parents who were zealots in the cause
of Royalism and Catholicism. They must have
regarded the coming of such a suitor as Wordsworth
with the same horror with which a reader
of the <i>Morning Post</i> would learn that his
daughter had fallen in love with a Catholic Sinn
Feiner or a Jewish Bolshevist. The position was
even more bitter than this suggests. The sectarian
and political passions that raged in France
were more comparable to the passions of Orange
Belfast than to any that can be imagined in the
atmosphere of modern England. Wordsworth
may well have appeared to these orthodox parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
a representative of Satan. He was the
murder-gang personified. Nor, to make up for
this, was he even a good match. He was an exceedingly
poor young man who had just come
of age. Add to this the fact that it was almost
impossible at the time for an orthodox Catholic
and Royalist to marry a Revolutionary sceptic.
Marriage had become a State affair under the
Revolution, and no Catholic could permit his
daughter to go through a marriage ceremony
that seemed to deny that marriage was a sacrament.
It is true that marriages could still be
performed by the clergy, but only by such clergy
as accepted their position under the new constitution
as functionaries of the State. Republican
clergy of this kind would be regarded by the Vallon
family as traitors and scarcely better than
atheists. Marriages celebrated by them would be
looked on as invalid—as mere licences to live in
sin. Had Wordsworth become a Catholic, or had
he been of a compromising disposition, it would
have been easy enough to find a non-juring priest
to perform the ceremony. But it is unlikely that
a priest, who was zealous enough to face persecution
rather than recognise the Republic, would
have been willing to marry one of his flock
to a free-thinking revolutionary. Respectability
might urge that, when the lovers had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
gone so far, nothing remained but to make the
best of it and permit them to marry. Fanaticism,
however, might well regard such a marriage as
but the adding of one sin to another. The Church
itself, by marrying the sinners, would make itself
a partner in the sin. We have to reflect
how adamantine is the faith of the orthodox in
order to understand the “many bars” that hindered
the marriage of Wordsworth and Annette.
Remembering this, we cannot dismiss as improbable
Professor Harper’s theory that Wordsworth
abandoned Marie-Anne reluctantly, and
that when he settled in Blois, he did so because
he had been driven away by her relatives and yet
desired to remain near her.</p>

<p>All we know of Wordsworth, and all the facts
in Professor Harper’s story, make it impossible
to believe that he would willingly have deserted
Marie-Anne and his daughter. The baptism of
the child was entered in the registry of baptisms
in the parish of Sainte-Croix, “Williams Wordsodsth”
in his absence being represented by a
local official. She was baptised Anne Caroline,
and it was as Anne Caroline Wordsworth,
daughter of “Williams Wordsworth, landowner,”
that she was married in Paris about
twenty-four years later. Wordsworth appears to
have kept constantly in touch with her and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
mother in the meantime, and, when peace was in
sight in 1802, he and his sister Dorothy determined
to cross to France and see them. A
meeting took place in Calais. It was the preliminary
to a marriage, but not to marriage with
Annette, who, indeed, never married, but went
through life as Madame Vallon. Two months
after the Calais meeting Wordsworth married
Mary Hutchinson. That he had been deeply
moved by the meeting with his child rather than
with her mother is suggested by the mood of the
sonnet he wrote at the time: “It is a beauteous
evening, calm and free.”</p>

<p>Professor Harper is of opinion that Wordsworth’s
love for Marie-Anne Vallon was an event
of supreme importance in his life. He holds that
the facts he has discovered throw “light upon
many of Wordsworth’s poems.” I do not think
that on this point he has proved his case. In his
two-volume life of Wordsworth, it may be remembered,
he even goes so far as to assign the
“Lucy” of so many beautiful poems to a French
original. Lovers of a great poet are naturally
led to speculate as to the experiences out of
which his poems grew. There is nothing of the
vice of Paul Pry in attempting thus to discover
the sources of the experiences the poet communicates
in his verse. The theme of every poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
is the experiences that have moved his soul most
profoundly. And many, or most, of those experiences
spring from his relations with other
human beings. At the same time, there is no
evidence that Wordsworth in his work was ever
influenced by Marie-Anne Vallon as Keats was
influenced by Fanny Brawne. It is doubtful if
any women every really took the place of his
sister in his heart. “She gave me eyes, she gave
me ears,” could be said only of Dorothy. It was
the fire of affection, not the fire of passion, that
glowed in Wordsworth’s soul. “Oh, my dear,
dear sister!” he cried in one of his letters, “with
what transport shall I again meet you! With
what rapture shall I again wear out the
day in your sight. So eager is my desire to
see you that all other obstacles vanish. I see
you in a moment running, or rather flying, to
my arms.” He was in life as in literature a
devoted brother rather than a devoted lover.
Even Professor Harper can give no other woman
but Dorothy the position of presiding genius over
his life and work. This does not necessarily involve
our acceptance of the common theory that
Dorothy was the original around whom the
“Lucy” poems were written. But, had Lucy
been a Frenchwoman, Wordsworth would hardly
have written:</p>

<p class="in0">To interpret this as a dramatisation of his early

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> I understand that Professor Harper disclaims what
seemed to me the obvious interpretation of a passage in
his book.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Harper, then, has discovered an
interesting episode in Wordsworth’s life, but I do
not think he has discovered what may be called a
key episode. It may turn out to have had more
influence on Wordsworth’s destiny than at
present appears. But we do not yet know
enough even about the circumstances to get any
fresh light from it either on his work or on his
character.</p>

<p>As regards Annette, we learn from a letter of
Dorothy’s, written in 1815, that she shared, and
continued to share, the Royalist convictions of
her people. She often, Dorothy affirms, “risked
her life in defence of adherents to that cause, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
she despised and detested Buonaparte.” In 1820,
Wordsworth, his wife, and Dorothy visited Paris
and lived on intimate terms with Annette,
Caroline, and Caroline’s husband. They even
went to lodge in the same street. Of Caroline
it was reported earlier that “she resembles her
father most strikingly.” For the rest, Christopher
Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln, when
writing his uncle’s biography, said nothing about
the matter. He cannot be accused of having
hidden anything of very great significance. The
truth is now out, and we know little more about
Wordsworth than we knew before.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE POETRY OF POE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">“My first object (as usual) was originality,”
said Poe, in discussing the versification of “The
Raven.” It is a remarkable fact that the two
great poets of America—Poe and Whitman—were
two of the most deliberately original poets
of the nineteenth century—in English at least.
They were both conscious frontiersmen of poetry,
drawn to unmapped territories, settlers on virgin
soil. This may help to explain some of their
imperfections. Each of them gives us the impression
of a genius rich but imperfectly cultivated.
Different though they were from each
other, they resembled each other in a certain lack
of the talent of order, of taste, of “finish.” They
were both capable of lapses from genius into incompetence,
from beauty into provincialism, to
an unusual degree. A contemporary critic said
of Poe that he had not talent equal to his genius.
Neither had Whitman. In the greatest poets,
genius and talent go hand in hand. Poe seldom
wrote a poem in which his mood seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
attained its perfect expression. His poetry does
not get near perfection even in the sense in which
Coleridge’s fragments do. It seems, as a rule,
like a first sketch for greater things. His
<i>Complete Poems</i>, indeed, is one of the most
wonderful sketch-books of a man of genius in
literature.</p>

<p>Poe himself attributed the defects of his work
to lack of leisure rather than to lack of talent.
“Events not to be controlled,” he said in the
preface to the 1845 edition of his poems, “have
prevented me from making, at any time, any
serious effort in what, under happier circumstances,
would have been the field of my choice.
With me poetry has been not a purpose but a
passion, and the passions should be held in
reverence; they must not—they cannot at will be
excited, with an eye to the petty compensations,
or the more petty commendations, of mankind.”
Other poets, however, who have lived in as bitter
circumstances as Poe, have written an incomparably
greater body of good poetry. There
was in him some flaw that kept him, as a rule,
from being more than a great beginner. It
may have been partly due to theatrical qualities
that he inherited from his actress mother. Again
and again he mingles the landscape of dreamland
with the tawdry grandeur of the stage. He takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
a footlights view of romance when, having begun
“Lenore” with the <span class="locked">lines——</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, broken is the golden bowl!—the spirit flown for ever!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">he continues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And, Guy de Vere, hast <i>thou</i> no tear?—weep now, or never more.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This, no doubt, was in tune with the fashionable
romance of the day, but Poe’s romantic conceptions
at times were those of one who was especially
entranced by stage trappings. He made
his heroines rich and highborn as well as beautiful.
In “Lenore” he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wretches, ye loved her for her wealth, and hated her for her pride!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In “The Sleeper” he speaks of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">The crested palls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of her grand family funerals.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In “Annabel Lee” he made the very angels
heroes of the green-room:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Her highborn kinsmen came</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And bore her away from me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">On the other hand, Poe’s theatricalism, though
it explains some of the faults of his poetry, leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
unexplained the fact that he has cast a greater
spell on succeeding poets than has even so great
a theatrical genius as Byron. Poe is one of those
poets who are sources of poetry. He discovered—though
not without forerunners such as
Coleridge—a new borderland for the imagination,
where death and despair had a new strangeness.
He seems to have reached it, not through
mere fancy, as his imitators do, but through
experience. When he was a youth he worshipped
Mrs. Helen Stannard, the mother of one of his
friends. She went mad and died, and for some
time after her death Poe used to haunt her tomb
by night, and “when the autumnal rains fell and
the winds wailed mournfully over the graves, he
lingered longest, and came away most regretfully.”
J.&nbsp;H. Ingram and other writers have
found in these “solitary churchyard vigils” the
clue to “much that seems strange and abnormal
in the poet’s after life.” Love overshadowed
by death, beauty overshadowed by death, remained
the recurrent theme of his verse. It is
the theme of his supreme poem, “Annabel Lee,”
with its haunting close:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the sepulchre there by the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In her tomb by the sounding sea.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Poe was a poet for whom life was darkened by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
experience and illuminated only by visions. In
the beginning, romance</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">loves to nod and sing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With drowsy head and painted wing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among the green leaves as they shake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Far down within some shadowy lake.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In time, however, this born day-dreamer can find
no comfort in day-dreaming:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of late, eternal Condor years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shake the very Heaven on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With tumult as they thunder by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have no time for idle cares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through gazing on the unquiet sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when an hour with calmer wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its down upon my spirit flings—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That little time with lyre and rhyme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To while away—forbidden things!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My heart would feel to be a crime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unless it trembled with the strings.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">There is a terrible sincerity in Poe’s sense of the
presence of death. His vision of mortal men, at
least, was not theatrical in its gloom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mimes, in the form of God on high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Mutter and mumble low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hither and thither fly—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Mere puppets they, who come and go</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">At bidding of vast formless things</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That shift the scenery to and fro,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flapping from out their Condor wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Invisible Woe!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Poe and Whitman were both poets preoccupied
with the thought of death, but, whereas Whitman
forced himself to praise it, Poe was in revolt
against it as the ultimate tyrant. He saw it as
the one thing that made dreadful those enchanted
islands, those enchanted valleys, those enchanted
palaces in which, for him, so much of the beauty
of the world took refuge. He could not reconcile
himself to a world that was governed by mortality.
There is the wistfulness of the exile from
a lost Paradise running through his verse. He is
essentially a man for whom the spiritual universe
exists. His angels and demons may not resemble
the angels and demons of the churches—may,
indeed, be little more than formulæ in his dreamland.
But they are at least the formulæ of a
poet into whose dreams has come the rumour of
immortality. He cannot believe that the City of
Death, with its awful stillness, can last for ever—that
city where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrines and palaces and towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Around, by lifting winds forgot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resignedly beneath the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The melancholy waters lie.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">He feels that somewhere Eldorado is to be found,
as it is by the knight who sought it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">And as his strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Failed him at length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He met a pilgrim shadow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">“Shadow,” said he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">“Where can it be—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This land of Eldorado?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Over the Mountains</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of the Moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the Valley of the Shadow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Ride, boldly ride,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The shade replied—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you seek for Eldorado!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It is true that his vision, whether of life or immortality,
has something of the incoherence of the
landscape of his “Dreamland”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mountains toppling evermore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into seas without a shore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">If his imagination passes “out of space, out of
time,” it is on the wings of trance rather than of
faith. At the same time, his dreams would not
have made so strong an appeal to generations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
readers if they had been mere sensational fancies,
and had not seemed to wander in a wider universe
than we are conscious of in our everyday life.
They cannot be dismissed as the visions of a
drugged man. They are the questionings of a
spirit.</p>

<p>It may be that, like some of the decadents of
Europe, Poe was preyed upon by a demon—that
he was an outcast poet in whose sky was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The cloud that took the form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of a demon in my view.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But in the best of the decadents the soul survived;
and if they have a place in literature it is
because they have left a record of the travels of
the prodigal soul in a far country. Poe, though
not sharing their decadence, is also the poet of a
far country. That loveliest of his poems (if we
except “Annabel Lee”), “To Helen”—what is
it but a triumphant cry of return? Unlike “The
Raven,” it is a poem that never loses its beauty
with repetition. “Annabel Lee” may be the
fullest expression of his genius, but “To Helen”
is the most exquisite. Even to write it down,
hackneyed though it is, renews one’s delight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Helen, thy beauty is to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Like those Nicean barks of yore,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That gently, o’er the perfumed sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The weary, way-born wanderer bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To his own native shore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On desperate seas long wont to roam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy Naiad airs have brought me home</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To the glory that was Greece</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the grandeur that was Rome.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">How statue-like I see thee stand</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, Psyche, from the regions which</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Are Holy Land!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Here, as nowhere else, Poe achieved coherent and
consummate grace of form. Here, if almost
nowhere else, his talent was equal to his genius.</p>

<span class="subhead">HAWTHORNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Hawthorne is the only American admitted into
the English Men of Letters Series. This may
be partly accidental, and due to the fact that it
was possible to get so fine a critic as Henry
James to write about him. It also suggests,
however, that in 1879 Hawthorne was held in
higher esteem than he is held to-day. There are
several American writers about whom we are
nowadays more curious. Emerson does not soar
at quite such an altitude as he once did, but he
is still an indubitable figure of genius on the
sunny side of the clouds. Thoreau, with the
challenge of his sardonic simplicity, will interest
us so long as there is a society to protest against.
Poe, after we have refined him in the fiercest
fires of criticism, remains gold of the most
precious. Whitman holds us as the giant
aborigine of democracy as well as the rhapsodist
of brotherhood and death. Washington Irving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
on the other hand, has disappeared except from
the schoolbooks, and Oliver Wendell Holmes has
ceased to be read by people under fifty. Longfellow
has become an exiguous contributor to an
anthology except in so far as he is taught, like
Irving, to schoolchildren, and Lowell is oftener
quoted by politicians than by critics of letters.
There is no need to discuss just now whether this
waning of reputations is likely to be permanent.
It is enough to note that Hawthorne, though he
has not waned to the extent that Longfellow has,
has ceased for most readers to be a star of the
first or second magnitude. How many critics
would now place him, as he was once placed,
among the great masters of English prose?
How many editors of a series of lives of great
writers would unhesitatingly include in it a life
of Nathaniel Hawthorne?</p>

<p>Hawthorne may nevertheless justly be regarded
as a classic, and there have been few
writers whose short stories would bear re-reading
so well as Hawthorne’s three-quarters of a
century after their first appearance. The prose,
as anyone may see by dipping into Mr. Carl van
Doren’s admirable selection from <i>Twice-told
Tales</i>, <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i>, and <i>The
Snow Image</i>, is beautiful prose, even if it falls
short of supreme greatness. It flows with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
rhythm at once charming and forceful. It is
transparent, and through it we can see life as
Hawthorne’s imagination played on it like sunlight
refracted through water. He is a music-maker
rather than a phrase-maker in his use of
words. Movement is more to him than metaphor,
though he can combine them attractively, as in
the opening sentence of <i>The Seven Vagabonds</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rambling on foot in the spring of my life and the
summer of the year, I came one afternoon to a point
which gave me the choice of three directions.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">You may turn Hawthorne’s pages almost at
random, and you can scarcely help noticing example
after example of this characteristic rhythm
of his. It is noticeable even in such a simple
narrative sentence as that with which <i>The Artist
of the Beautiful</i> opens:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An elderly man, with his pretty daughter on his arm,
was passing along the street, and emerged from the
gloom of the cloudy evening into the light that fell across
the pavement from the window of a small shop.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And, again, we find it in a meditative passage
such as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw mankind, in this weary old age of the world,
either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and dust of cities, or, if they breathed a purer air, still
lying down at night with no hope but to wear out to-morrow,
and all the to-morrows which make up life,
among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched
toil that had darkened the sunshine of to-day.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">This all flows with something of the noble ease of
hexameters, yet without falling into the vices of
pseudo-poetic prose. The mere sound of his
sentences gives Hawthorne’s prose a wonderful
momentum that keeps us interested even when at
times we begin to wonder if his subject-matter is
quite as interesting as it ought to be. This grave
and equable momentum is one of his greatest
technical qualities. It is a quality that cannot be
adequately illustrated in single sentences or detached
passages, because its success is not the
success of occasional felicities but of something
sustained and pervasive. It may even be imputed
as a fault to Hawthorne that he can never, or
almost never, escape from the equable rhythm of
his prose. He seldom ends a story with the
slightly different momentum due to an ending.
It is not merely, however, that his stories end
quietly: he is like a rider who rides beautifully
but does not know how to dismount. He maintains
his graceful ease of motion until the last
moment, and then he slides off as best he can.</p>

<p>But it would be folly to regard Hawthorne’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
rhythm as wholly—or even mainly—a technical
quality. The rhythm of prose is never that, and
it is in vain to play the sedulous ape to the great
masters if nothing but their style is imitated. It
is not an accident that the greatest English prose
is to be found in the Bible. The rhythm of the
greatest prose seems at times the rhythm of the
spirit of man as it contemplates the life of men in
the light of eternity. The rhythm to a Plato, a
Milton, a Sir Thomas Browne, is inevitably of
a kind that a Jane Austen or a Thackeray, with
all their genius, could never achieve. It is the
echo of the emotion felt by men to whom time and
place are fables with another meaning besides
that which appears on the surface. The realists
can never write the greatest prose, because to
them the world they see is not fabulous but a
hard fact. The greatest writers all see the world
as fabulous. Their men and women are inhabited
by angels or devils, or, on a lower plane, have
something of the nature of ghosts or fairies or
goblins. If Othello were not a fable as well as a
man, he would be no better than a criminal
lunatic. If King Lear were not a fable as well
as man, he would be a subject for the psychoanalyst.
Imagine either of them as a modern
Englishman, putting his case before a judge and
jury, and you will see how the artist, even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
his characters as a rule are characters such as
may be found in reality, must remove them
out of and above reality into the region of fables
in order to make them permanently real to the
imagination. Dickens turned Victorian England
into a myth peopled by goblins. Dostoievsky
turned Russia into a myth peopled by goblins
and demons. It is not that they denied the
reality of the world before their eyes, but that
they saw within it and about it another world
apart from which it had very little meaning.</p>

<p>Hawthorne was a writer extremely conscious
of this second world within and about the world.
He had abandoned the Puritanical orthodoxy of
his people, but none the less he was haunted like
them by a sense of a second meaning in life
beyond the surface meaning of the day’s work
and the day’s play. Many of his stories are
stories in which, as in <i>Young Goodman Brown</i>,
everyday reality passes into fable and back again
as swiftly as though the two worlds were but
different stages in a transformation scene. His
genius turned more naturally to allegory than
any other writer’s since Bunyan. This is generally
counted a defect, and, indeed, if, instead of
alternating the everyday world with the fabulous
world, he had interwoven them in such a way
that the world never became less real on account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
of the fable it bore within it like an inner light,
Hawthorne would have been a greater writer.
At the same time, it is better that he should have
sacrificed observation than that he should have
sacrificed imagination. He lived in an atmosphere
in which it must have been extraordinarily
difficult to stand sufficiently remote from everyday
life to see it not merely with the eye but
with the imagination. To the eye, there must
have been little enough of fantasy in the narrow
lives of the men and women about him. “Never
comes any bird of Paradise into that dismal
region,” he wrote of the Custom-house in which
he passed so many years and that made “such
havoc of his wits.” He had to transform his
surroundings into a strange land into which a
bird of Paradise might enter. He did this by the
invention of a sort of moral fairyland, into which
he could project his vision of the mystery of
human life. He often offends our sense of
reality, but he never leaves us in doubt of the
reality of this moral fairyland as the image of all
he knew and felt about human life. It is a
Puritanical fairyland into which sin has come.
But, strong though his sense of sin is, Hawthorne
does not always in his view of sin agree with the
Puritans. He is more Christian, and he condemns
the sin of self-righteousness more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
the sins of the flesh. Even so, his imagination is
very close to that of the Puritans, who believed
in witches and in men possessed by the Devil.
The difference is that Hawthorne was inclined
to believe that the good church-going people were
also witches and men possessed by the Devil.
Unless I misunderstand <i>Young Goodman
Brown</i>, Hawthorne is here telling us how he was
tempted to believe this, and reproaching himself
for having given way to temptation. In <i>The
Scarlet Letter</i>, the egoism of the vengeful
husband, not the adultery of the wife or the
cowardice of the minister who sins with her, is
the unpardonable sin of the story. That Hawthorne’s
imaginative morality had the vehemence
of genius is shown by the fact that <i>The Scarlet
Letter</i> still holds us under its spell in days in
which moral values have subtly and swiftly
changed. People are no longer thrilled at the
thought of a scarlet A on a woman’s breast; they
would scarcely be thrilled by the spectacle of a
whole scarlet alphabet hung round a woman’s
neck like a collar. Yet Hawthorne’s novel survives—a
fable of the permanent and dubious
warfare between good and evil, in which good
changes its shape into that of evil, and evil is
transmuted into good through suffering. His
genius survives, like that of Hans Andersen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
because, not only does it carry the burden of
morality, but it is led on its travels by a fancy
wayward and caressing as the summer wind. He
is the first prose myth-maker of America, and he
has left no successors in his kind.</p>

<span class="subhead">JONAH IN LANCASHIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">The author of <i>Patience</i>—the other <i>Patience</i>, I
mean, not the Gilbert opera—is beginning to be
discovered even by the average reader. It is not
long since we had modernised versions of his two
most remarkable poems, <i>Pearl</i> and <i>Sir Gawayne
and the Green Knight</i>. Gaston Paris describes
the latter as “the jewel of English mediæval
literature,” and even among those who read idly
for amusement it should become a favourite book
in Mr. Ernest Kirtlan’s easy rendering. Who
the maker of these poems was we know not.
Editors have invented a personal history for him,
but other editors have ruthlessly pulled it to
pieces. It was suggested that he wrote the romance
<i>Sir Gawayne</i> in his gaudy youth. Then,
having lost a child, he composed in <i>Pearl</i> a
passionate lament for her. Afterwards, in the
evening of his life, he wrote <i>Patience</i> as an expression
of his submission to the will of God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Mr. Bateson will have nothing to do either with
this pathetic life-history or with the chronology.
He regards <i>Patience</i> as the earliest of the poems,
and is of the opinion that <i>Pearl</i>, far from being a
lament for a lost child, is “largely a theological
discussion in elegiac form.” One would think
there must be something seriously wrong in a
poem about which a dispute of the kind could
rage among the interpreters. But this is not
necessarily so. No one denies that the <i>Song of
Solomon</i> is a great poem, and yet men have
quarrelled as to whether it should be read as the
holiest of symbolic poems or as an early masterpiece
of the fleshly school of literature. Coming
to <i>Patience</i> itself, I fancy that the man who
could discover personal confessions in it could
discover personal confessions in Euclid. I find
it difficult to believe in the bereaved father who
turned for a lesson in resignation to the story of
Jonah. It is the homilist, not the tortured human
being, who fishes in the Book of Jonah for comfortable
morals. <i>Patience</i> is a sermon addressed
to other people, not to the poet’s own soul. Feeling
this, one may allow oneself to be amused
by its quaintness as well as to admire the hue and
vigour of its narrative.</p>

<p><i>Patience</i> is the story of Jonah told by an
original artist. Jonah is here painted in English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
colours. He is the Jonah not of a tragic-hearted
Hebrew but of a familiar Lancashire man who
wrote in a Lancashire dialect at the time of
Chaucer. Tertullian had written a Latin poem
on the same theme, and Mr. Bateson gives us
the text of this in an appendix, suggesting, as
other scholars have done, that it is one of the
sources of <i>Patience</i>. The Jonah of Tertullian,
however, is a formal figure compared to the
Jonah of the Englishman. Jonah in the old
Lancashire poem is a lithe and live fellow from
the moment at which he steps aboard the ship to
make his escape from the perilous will of God.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Was neuer so joyful a Jue as Jonas was thenne,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">we are told in a lively line at this point of the
narrative. The storm that follows is described
with such a sense of reality that it has been
suggested that the poet himself must have experienced
some such tempest when making a
pilgrimage to Compostella, “the favourite journey
of Englishmen at the time,” and a journey
of the ancient popularity of which we are still
reminded in the streets of London once a year
when children set up their grottoes on the footpaths
as an excuse for begging pennies. Mr.
Bateson attempts to bring home to us the desperate
circumstances of seafaring in the Middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Ages by quoting the statement that “John of
Gaunt, on one occasion, was tossing about in the
Channel for nine months, unable to land at
Calais.” I confess I cannot believe the story in
this form, and we need no such incredible
example to enable us to realise the terrors of the
storm that swept down on Jonah, when the
frightened sailors attempted to lighten the ship
by throwing overboard</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Her bagges, and her feather-beddes, and her bryght
wedes.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">The introduction of the feather-beds into the
narrative would alone be a sufficient reason for
welcoming the Lancashire version of the Jonah
story. The description of the panic-stricken
sailors “glewing,” or calling, on their very various
gods (who included Fernagu, a French giant)
is another addition that pleases by its strangeness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bot vchon glewed on his god thet gayned hym beste;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Summe to Vernagu ther vouched avowes solemne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Summe to Diana deuout, and derf Nepturne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Mahoun and to Mergot, the Mone and the Sunne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Both in Tertullian and in <i>Patience</i> Jonah is made
not only to sleep but to snore while the others
pray during the storm. Tertullian puts it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sternentem inflata resonabat nare soporem.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>
<p class="in0">The English poet writes still more vividly that
Jonah lay in the bottom of the boat,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Slypped vpon a sloumbe-slepe, and sloberande he routes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">A “freke,” or man, was sent to rouse him and to
prepare him for the casting of lots:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The freke hym frunt with his fot, and bede hym ferk up.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Then came the casting of the lots:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And ay the lote, vpon laste, lymped on Jonas.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The sailors immediately began to upbraid Jonah
in masculine English:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What the deuel hest thou don, dotede wrech?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What seches thou on see, synful schrewe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thy lastes [crimes] so luther [evil] to lose vus vchone?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Soon after follows the decision to throw him
overboard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now is Jonas the Jwe jugged to drowne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">“A wylde walteande whale” comes up opportunely
to the side of the boat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And swyftely swenged hym to swepe, and his swallow opened...,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With-outen towche of any tothe he tult in his throte.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>
<p class="in0">In spite of his safe passage beyond the whale’s
teeth, however, Jonah’s plight was not an enviable
one:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lorde! colde was his cumfort, and his care huge.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The poet describes him as passing down the
throat like a “mote in at a minster door”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He glydes in by the gills ...;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ay, hele ouer hed, hourlande aboute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Til he blunt [staggered] in a blok as brod as a halle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ther he festnes the fete, and fathmes about,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And stod up in his stomak, that stank as the deuel.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">So realistic is the description of the whale’s inside
that Mr. Bateson thinks it likely that the
poet had been listening to the stories of whalers.
He also endorses the poet’s view of the horrors of
the situation by quoting one writer who states
that “the breath of the whale is frequently
attended by such an insupportable smell as to
bring on disorder of the brain.” If the whale
made Jonah feel sick, however, Jonah, according
to the poet, had much the same effect on the
whale. In a moving two lines on the whale’s
discomforts we are told:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For thet mote in his mawe made hym, I trowe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though hit lyttel were hym wyth, to wamel at his hert.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>
<p class="in0">These two lines Mr. Bateson translates into
colourless modern English: “For the mote made
him—though it were little as compared with him—to
feel sick,” and adds for our information that
“the reader of whaling stories will recall how
frequently the whale suffers from dyspepsia!”</p>

<p>We need not follow the poet in detail through
the rest of the narrative, which is full of life-giving
detail till the end. After God had commanded
the <span class="locked">whale——</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That he hym sput spakly vpon spare drye,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">we see Jonah washing his muddy mantle on the
beach and proceeding with his message of doom
to the “burgesses and bachelors” of Nineveh.
The gourd under which he sleeps becomes a
“wodbynde” (some kind of convolvulus): it is
“hedera,” or ivy, in the Vulgate. Jonah’s delight,
as he lay under it—“so glad of his gay
lodge”—is amusingly described. <span class="locked">He——</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lys loltrande ther-inne lokande to toune.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">So contentedly did he “loll” there, indeed—“so
blithe of his wood-bine”—that he cared not a
penny for any “diet” that day; and when it
“nighed to night” and “nappe hym bihoued,”
he slept the sleep of the just “vnder leues.” In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
his account of Jonah’s anger against God, and
God’s argument in favour of sparing Nineveh,
the poet elaborates as ever the Bible narrative,
and the appeal for the right of the inhabitants to
live is tenderer than in the more concise original.
God pleads, for instance, for the “lyttel bairnes
on barme (breast) that neuer bale wrought,” and
the reference to “much cattle” becomes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And als ther ben doumbe bestes in the burgh many.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I do not suggest that <i>Patience</i> is better than the
Book of Jonah, or as good, but that it has the
vitality of an original work. The poet has a
personal knowledge of character—a sense of
drama, and a sense of life. Mr. Bateson’s edition
of the poem was first published seven years ago.
He has now largely recast and rewritten it. I
have taken some liberties with his text in quoting
it, slightly modernising it in places. It is an
edition for students of mediæval literature rather
than for the general reader. But with the help
of its excellent glossary others than scholars
should be able to enjoy it if they are prepared to
take a little pains. And it is worth taking pains
to become acquainted with so vivid and robust
a poet as the author of <i>Sir Gawayne and the
Green Knight</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CULT_OF_DULLNESS"><span id="toclink_159"></span>THE CULT OF DULLNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Many conflicting opinions were expressed on the
occasion of the Keats centenary, but everybody
appeared to be unanimous on at least one point—contempt
for the critics who told Keats to go
back to his gallipots. We took it for granted that
they were a very unusual sort of critics, and that,
if a Keats were born to-day, we should give him a
different sort of welcome. It is as though we had
forgotten the history of literary genius and of its
first reception into a jealous world. Human
beings have naturally a profound respect for the
great man, but they respect him most when he
is dead. A dead demigod is to them infinitely
better than a living lion. Their self-respect suffers
if they have to live in the same world with
some young fellow that overtops them. They
feel, unconsciously, that by bringing him down
they are raising themselves up. The Greeks
pretended that it was the gods, and not themselves,
who were jealous of human greatness, and
they called this jealousy Nemesis. I suspect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
however, that it was human beings who first felt
this passion for equality. It is not in this form
a noble passion. It is a passion for being equal to
the people above us, not for being equal to the
people below. This is the passion that cannot
forgive wit or beauty in a contemporary.
Some men—the finest—are entirely without it.
Further, most of us yield to facts and frankly
recognise genius when there is no getting away
from it. But there always remains a company of
the dull and the crabbed who believe till the end
that to disparage a good writer is to be, at least
on this point, superior to him. They are afraid
that if the world welcomes this wit and beauty
it will have no welcome for their own dullness.
That is the secret fear that is a cause of a great
deal of the worst sort of bad criticism. There
is a league of dullness constantly making war
on wit and beauty. Its malice is not deliberate:
it is scarcely intelligent enough to be deliberate.
It is founded not on reason, but on the instinct of
self-defence.</p>

<p>It is difficult, I admit, to say how far the disparagement
of good writing is the result of mere
stupidity and how far it is the result of malignity.
The longer one lives, the more one is amazed at
the incredible achievements of human stupidity.</p>

<p>Possibly, then, the critics who attempted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
drag down Keats to the level of bad writers were
merely ordinary stupid human beings—good
men in the bosoms of their families, but fools anywhere
else. They had, after all, standards to
which Keats did not conform. They had either
to abuse Keats or to trample on their standards—which
would have been like trampling on themselves.
Keats himself, by the vehemence of his
attack on Pope and his followers, had provoked
the controversial spirit. He was to them a blasphemer
in the temple, who had to be punished at
all costs. There is much the same reason, no
doubt, for the virulence with which the dull have
assailed the wits in all ages. Wit by its very
nature is a declaration of war not only on dullness,
but on the dull orthodoxies, and the dull and
the orthodox return bite for blow. Molière
brought great trouble on his head by being witty.
He held the mirror up to fools, and in answer the
fools baited him. He had not all the critics
against him, but only all the stupid critics. That
is a distinction that should always be remembered
in any discussion on literary criticism. Many
writers, wearied by the slings and arrows of outrageous
critics, have settled down into the easy
conviction that all criticism is a waste of words.
Disraeli dismissed the whole brood of critics in
the saying that critics are those who have failed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
literature. This, of course, is a libel on a reputable
art. The success of such critics as Mr.
Saintsbury and Mr. Gosse is literary success as
desirable as that of most poets or novelists. At
the same time, there is a half-truth in the saying
of Disraeli. There is no critic who does more
injury to the reputation of his art than the embittered
failure—the man who has shouted in the
world’s ear and has yet not made himself heard.
To speak to a deaf man makes some people
angry: to speak to a deaf world has the same
effect on many writers. Nature is kind, and she
enables writers of this sort to deceive themselves
into thinking that their ill-natured egoism is a
sort of divine anger on behalf of great art. Their
self-righteousness masks itself as literary piety.
Coleridge a hundred years ago noticed the irritability
of minor poets—“men of undoubted talents
but not of genius,” whose tempers are “rendered
yet more irritable by their desire to <i>appear</i> men
of genius.” That is the irritation that is the cause
of so much bad criticism. The critic who feels
irritated should begin to suspect himself, and ask
himself whether it is the excellences or the faults
of the work he is criticising that have put him in
a temper. We are often told in these days that
criticism is too gentle. In a world in which such
a mass of criticism is being written it is difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
to sum up the tendencies of the whole period in a
phrase. There may be an excess of unintelligent
praise, but there is also, it seems to me, an excess
of unintelligent carping and ill-tempered denigration.
The present age, like Coleridge’s,
might be described as “this age of personality,
this age of literary and political gossiping, when
the meanest insects are worshipped with a sort
of Egyptian superstition, if only the brainless
head be atoned for by the sting of personal
malignity in the tail.”</p>

<p>Not that even men of genius have always been
just to each other. Byron was unjust to Shakespeare
and Keats: Keats was unjust to Pope.
But we do not demand sound criticism as a right
from a great poet, who may easily feel the
partiality of a specialist. The meanness of the
mean critic is of quite another sort. He is a
fox without a tail, who could only feel important
in a world of foxes without tails. He is always
in search of a standard according to which even
he will have a chance of seeming great. That is
why in every generation good writers are attacked
and dull writers are exalted by this sort
of critic. The cult of the dull, of the mediocre,
is necessary in order that he, too, may win some
reverence. The whole thing is, it seems to me,
a pathetic delusion. The critic may for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
organise fame for dull painters and dull writers,
and he may win a year’s or ten years’ praise
by doing so. But all the time he is losing that
generous and disinterested spirit which is one of
the most precious possessions of the artist. The
ordinary writer sets out with the hope of
qualifying for a place in the temple of fame:
he ends too often by merely qualifying for a
place in the <i>Dunciad</i>. He may be a man of
one talent, which would serve well enough if
put to proper uses, but he prefers to hide it
and to pretend that it is ten, railing all the while
at others on the ground that they have only
five. I used to think that it was un-Christian of
the Founder of Christianity to give the man
with one talent so poor a name compared to the
man with five or the man with ten. But I have
long since come to see that in doing so he spoke
out of a profound knowledge of human nature.
The man with one talent is the most likely of all
to make no use of it. He does not see that
even his poverty may be turned into riches, as
is obvious when one remembers such Lilliputian
and immortal poets as Lovelace. He is blinded
by a sense of his insignificance. He has the false
humility of the frog, which is not content to be
a first-rate frog but must try to swell itself
into a bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>The spectacle of the bad critic would be matter
for pity were it not that he has some influence on
the immediate fate of good writers. He cannot
prevent the recognition of a Keats, but he can
delay it. “Mr. Hunt,” said <i>Blackwood’s</i>, “is a
small poet, but he is a clever man. Mr. Keats is a
still smaller poet, and he is only a boy of pretty
abilities, which he has done everything in his
power to spoil.... We venture to make one
small prophecy, that his bookseller will not a
second time venture £50 upon anything he can
write.” The attacks on Keats, it has been contended,
were animated by political rather than
literary rivalry. But, whatever their origin, they
were a crime against the spirit of disinterestedness,
which is the holy spirit of criticism. Niggardliness
with praise is as shabby a vice as
niggardliness with money, and I have often
noticed that the man who is a miser with the one
is a miser with the other. It is the most unattractive
form of selfishness. The critics, however,
did not write down Keats: they succeeded only
in writing down themselves. And yet, every now
and then, we find someone clamouring for a return
of the good old days of <i>Blackwood’s</i> and the
<i>Quarterly</i>. Are our own days, then, lacking in
“foolish, trivial, almost ostentatiously dishonest”
criticism? It would be pleasant to think so. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
I suspect that folly and dishonesty have not disappeared
but have merely changed their style.
What is needed in criticism to-day, as always, is
the sympathetic imagination. A fool with a
sledge-hammer is of no service to literature. We
need the comic sense to laugh at folly, the moral
sense to make war on cant. There is no need for
wrath in criticism except in presence of pretentiousness.
The pretentious is the grand enemy of
literature as of religion. But in regard to the
small sins of literature, we may as well cultivate
the same tolerance that a good-natured man feels
towards the small sins of life. To be tolerant is
not to resign either one’s moral or artistic standards.
The greatest moralists of the world have
been the most tolerant. Intolerance, indeed, is
only a part of the general cult of dullness. It
would confine the arts to a coterie, and steal
Shakespeare himself from the world at large, on
the ground that the world cannot appreciate him.
It would turn literature into a pedantic mystery,
and make an end of it as a noble entertainment.
But, alas, intolerance and dullness are immortal,
and we shall always have a war between them, on
the one hand, and the Keatses and the Molières
on the other. And the Keatses and the Molières
will go on writing, and it may be that they would
not be so firmly rooted if it were not for the fierce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
wind of stupid words that so constantly assails
them. All may be for the best. Without dullness
to contend against, beauty and wit might succumb
to Capua.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. MAX BEERBOHM</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>1. THE STUDENT OF PERFECTION</h3>

<p class="in0">Mr. Max Beerbohm generally leaves us with the
impression that he has written something perfect.
He is, indeed, one of those writers to whom perfection
is all-important, not only on account of
their method, but on account of their subject
matter. He is not a man engaged in a Laocoon
struggle with his imagination—a man desperately
at grips with a tremendous theme. He is
more comparable to a laundress than to Laocoon.
His work has the perfection of a starched shirt-front,
which if it is not perfect is nothing. Mr.
Beerbohm takes what may be called an evening-dress
view of life. One would not be surprised
to learn that he writes in evening dress. He has
that air of good conversation without intimacy,
of deliberate charm, of cool and friendly brilliance
that always shows at its best above a shining
and expressionless shirt-front. He belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the world in which it is good form to forget the
passions, except for their funny side, and in which
the persiflage is more indispensable than the port.
Not much good literature has been written in this
spirit in England. The masterpieces of persiflage
in English literature are, in verse, <i>The
Rape of the Lock</i> and, in prose, <i>The Importance
of Being Earnest</i>. Can anybody name three
other masterpieces in the same kind? Everyone
who reads <i>Seven Men</i> can name one. It is called
<i>Seven Men</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Beerbohm is, in the opinion of some good
critics, best of all as a parodist. His <i>Christmas
Garland</i> contains the finest prose parodies in the
language. And, even outside his confessed parodies,
he remains a parodist in the greater part of
his work. In <i>Seven Men</i> he is both a parodist of
Henry James and a caricaturist of men of letters.
Henry James loved to take a man of letters as his
hero: Mr. Beerbohm loves to take a man of letters
as a figure of fun. His men of letters have none
of that dignity with which they are invested in
“The Death of a Lion.” They are simply people
to tell amusing stories about, as monarchs and
statesmen become at a dinner-table. This does
not mean that Mr. Beerbohm is not a devoted
disciple of literature. There is a novelist, Maltby,
in one of his stories, who lives in the suburbs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
writes a successful novel about aristocratic life,
and afterwards writes an unsuccessful novel
about suburban life. “I suppose,” he says, explaining
his failure, “one can’t really understand
what one doesn’t love, and one can’t make good
fun without real understanding.” We may
reasonably take this as Mr. Beerbohm’s own
apologia. He has a sincere tenderness for this
world he derides. In <i>A Christmas Garland</i> he
protests his admiration for the victims of his
parodies. And as we read <i>Seven Men</i> we feel
sure that it is his extreme devotion to the world
of letters that leads him to choose it as the theme
of his mockery. When he writes of men of letters—especially
of the exquisitely minor men of
letters—he is like a man speaking his own
language in his own country. When he wanders
outside the world of authors he writes under a
sense of limitations, like a man venturing into a
foreign tongue. In <i>Seven Men</i> the least remarkable
of the five stories—though it, too, would
seem remarkable in any less brilliant company—is
“James Pethel,” the story of a financier, who
lives for the sake of risks and who is happiest
when he is risking not only himself but those he
loves—his daughter, for instance, or a favourite
author. The description of a motor drive, on
which he takes his wife and daughter and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Beerbohm in Normandy, with its many hair-breadth
escapes, is an excellent piece of comico-sensational
literature. But the story reads like
hearsay, not like reminiscences of a man’s own
world. One does not believe that Pethel ever
existed, or that he enjoyed drinking water in
France simply because there was a risk of typhoid.
Even the motor drive is not quite “convincing.”
Or, perhaps, one should say that, while
the motor drive itself is immensely convincing,
James Pethel’s state of mind as he drives the car
is not. Henry James might have made of him a
queer study in morbid psychology. Mr. Beerbohm
has hardly raised him above the level of a
joke. It lacks the thrill of masterly and intimate
portraiture. “A.&nbsp;V. Laider” is another story with
a non-literary theme. It is, perhaps, the most
refined example of leg-pulling in fiction. It is
one of those stories in which the reader is worked
up to a moment of intense horror only to be let
down with mockery by the narrator. Everything
in it is perfectly done—the grey introduction at
the rainy seaside, the railway accident foreseen in
the palms of several of the passengers, and the
final confession and comment. If not a man of
letters, A.&nbsp;V. Laider is at least a man of imagination,
and Mr. Beerbohm knows the type.</p>

<p>As to which of Mr. Beerbohm’s burlesque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
portraits of authors is the best, opinions quite
properly differ. The votes that “Savonarola”
Brown loses for the burlesque of his personality
he wins back again for the burlesque of his play.
Brown was a dramatist who chose his subject on a
novel principle. He originally thought of writing
a tragedy about Sardanapalus, but on looking
this up in the Encyclopædia his eye fell on “Savonarola,”
and what he read interested him. He
did not allow himself to be hampered, however,
by historical facts, but adopted the policy of
allowing his characters to live their own lives. In
the result his blank-verse tragedy introduces us
to most of the famous and infamous figures in
Italian history. Had Brown lived to finish the
fifth act, there is no doubt that he would have introduced
Garibaldi—perhaps even D’Annunzio—into
his coruscating pageant. He has certainly
achieved the most distinguished list of <i>dramatis
personæ</i> ever crowded into a brief play. The play
as we now possess it can hardly be described as a
parody. At least, it is not a parody on any particular
play. It makes fun at the expense not
only of the worst writer of blank verse now living,
but of Shakespeare himself. It is like one of
those burlesque operas that were popular thirty
years ago, and some of the speeches might have
been stolen from <i>Julius Cæsar Up-to-Date</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
opening scene introduces us not only to a Friar
and a Sacristan (wigged by Clarkson), but to
Savonarola, Dante, Lucrezia Borgia, Leonardo
da Vinci, and St. Francis of Assisi. Savonarola,
on seeing Lucrezia, cries, “Who is this wanton?”
St. Francis, with characteristic gentleness, reproves
him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Hush, Sir! ’tis my little sister</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The poisoner, right well-beloved by all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom she as yet hath spared.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The central interest of the play is the swaying
intensity of the love of the poisoner and Savonarola.
In his passion Savonarola at one moment
discards the monkish frock for the costume of a
Renaissance nobleman. But the sight of his legs
temporarily kills Lucrezia’s feeling for him.
She scornfully bids him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Go pad thy calves!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus mightst thou just conceivably with luck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Capture the fancy of some serving-wench.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This being too much for him, they part in the
mood of revenge, and, after Lucrezia has made a
desperate effort to force a poisoned ring on him,
they both find themselves in gaol. When the curtain
rises on Savonarola’s cell, he has been in
prison three hours. “Imprisonment,” says the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
stage direction, “has left its mark on both of
them. Savonarola’s hair has turned white. His
whole aspect is that of a very old, old man.
Lucrezia looks no older than before, but has gone
mad.” How like nine-tenths of the prison scenes
one has seen on the stage! But never on the stage
has one heard a prison soliloquy half so fine as
Savonarola’s, from its opening sentence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas, how long ago this morning seems</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This evening!—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">down to its close:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">What would my sire have said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what my dam, had anybody told them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The time would come when I should occupy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A felon’s cell? O the disgrace of it!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scandal, the incredible come-down!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It masters me. I see i’ my mind’s eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The public prints—“Sharp Sentence on a Monk!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What then? I thought I was of sterner stuff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than is affrighted by what people think.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet thought I so because ’twas thought of me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so ’twas thought of me because I had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hawk-like profile and a baleful eye.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! my soul’s chin recedes, soft to the touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As half-churn’d butter. Seeming hawk is dove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dove’s a gaolbird now. Fie, out upon ’t!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I do not think that anyone has produced a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
unforgettable line of heroic decasyllabic verse
than:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The scandal, the incredible come-down!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Savonarola’s fame will be increased as a result of
that exquisitely inappropriate line. It is infinitely
regrettable that Brown did not live to write the
fifth act of his masterpiece. Mr. Beerbohm has
attempted a scenario for a fifth act, and it contains
many admirable things. But Mr. Beerbohm
lacks Brown’s “magnifical” touch, though he does
his best to imitate it in the lines in which he makes
Lucrezia say that she means:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To start afresh in that uncharted land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which austers not from out the antipod,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Australia!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Good as this is, it seems just to verge on parody.
It is grotesque where Brown would have been
moving. The play as a whole, however, will find
a place among the minor classics. It is far, far
better than going to the pantomime. It is as good
as the pantomime ought to be.</p>

<p>“Maltby and Braxton” is something new in
literature—a comic ghost story. There are plenty
of funny stories about ghosts that did not exist.
This is a funny story about a ghost that did exist.
It is a story of the jealousy of two novelists of the
’nineties, and tells how one of them was pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
by the ghost of his jealous rival to a week-end at
a duchess’s. It is a nightmare seen objectively—everybody’s
nightmare.</p>

<p>In “Enoch Soames”—which is the masterpiece
of the book—Mr. Beerbohm fools, but he fools
wisely. He never takes his eye off human nature.
He draws not only a caricature, but a man. The
minor poet—the utterly incompetent minor poet—has
never before been drawn so brilliantly and
with so much intelligence as in “Enoch Soames.”
The pretentiousness, the inclination to disparage,
the egotism, the affected habits and beliefs—bad
poets (and some less bad ones) have had them in
all ages, but the type has not before been collected
and pinned in a glass case. “Enoch Soames” is a
perfect fable for egotists. It might be described as
a sympathetic exposure. One feels almost sorry
for Soames as Mr. Beerbohm subjects him
to the terrible justice of the comic imagination.
“Enoch Soames” is a moral tale into which the
Devil himself enters as a character. Mr. Beerbohm
made his reputation as an eccentric writer.
In this story he suggests an attitude the reverse of
eccentric. Perhaps it is that middle-age has
descended on him. He has certainly added wisdom
to playfulness, and in the result has painted
an imaginary portrait which is as impressively
serious as it is brilliantly entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<h3>2. “MAX” IN DANGER</h3>

<p>Mr. Beerbohm is in danger of being canonised.
Critics may quarrel about him, but it is only because
the wreaths get in the way of one another,
and every critic thinks that his should be on top.
They have even discovered that “Max” has a
heart. “Max” may plead that it is only a little
one, but that will not save him. Some other critic
will discover that he has a message, and someone
else will announce that he has a metaphysic. In
order to avert this unseemly canonisation—or, at
least, to keep it within the bounds of reason—one
would like to adopt the ungracious part of <i>advocatus
diaboli</i> and state the case against “Max” in
the strongest possible terms. But, alas! one finds
that there is nothing to say against him, except
that he is not Shakespeare or Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>One of the charms of Mr. Beerbohm is that he
never pretends to be what he is not. He knows
as well as anybody that he is not an oak of the
forest, but a choice bloom grown from seed in a
greenhouse, and even now lord of a pot rather
than of a large garden. His art, at its best, is
praise of art, not praise of life. Without the arts,
the world would be meaningless to him. If he
rewrote the plays of Shakespeare, he would make
Hamlet a man who lacked the will to write the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
last chapter of a masterpiece, and Othello an
author who murdered his wife because her books
sold better than his, and King Lear a tedious old
epic poet who perpetually recited his own verse
till his daughters were able to endure it no longer
and locked him out for the night. Cordelia, for
her part, would be a sweet little creature, whose
love for the old man was stronger than her literary
sense, and who would slip out of a window
and join him where he stamped up and down in
the shrubbery, tripping over the bushes, cursing
her more fastidious sisters, and booming out his
bad verse to her and the rain. Mr. Beerbohm’s
world is exclusively populated by authors, save
for a few painters, sculptors, actors, musicians,
and people who do not matter. One has to include
the people who do not matter, because
otherwise one’s generalisation would not be true.</p>

<p>Most people are agreed that Mr. Beerbohm’s
recent work is his best. Consider his last three
books, then, and how little of them could have
come into existence, save in a world of authors.
<i>A Christmas Garland</i>, his masterpiece, is a book
of prose parodies on authors. <i>Seven Men</i>—yes,
that, too, is his masterpiece—is a book in which
every character that one remembers is an author
or, at least, a liar. There were Enoch Soames
with his poems, Ladbroke Brown with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
<span class="allsmcap">BEAU</span>-tiful play (as Swinburne would have said)
on Savonarola, and the rival novelists of that adventurous
week-end with the aristocracy. And
in his last book, <i>And Even Now</i>, we find once
more a variegated human comedy in which all the
principal characters are authors and artists or
their works, and other human beings are only
allowed to walk on as supers. First of all we have
“A Relic,” in which Mr. Beerbohm sees a pretty
lady in a temper, and a short, fat man waddling
after her, and determines to write a story about
them. He does not write it, but he writes a story
about the story he did not write. Then comes
“How Shall I Word It?”—a joke about a “complete
letter-writer” bought at a railway bookstall.
This is followed by “Mobled King,”
describing a statue to King Humbert, which,
though erected, has never been unveiled because
the priests and the fishermen object, and concluding
with a wise suggestion that “there would
be no disrespect, and there would be no violence,
if the bad statues familiar to London were ceremoniously
veiled, and their inscribed pedestals
left just as they are.” Fourth comes “Kolniyatch”—a
spoof account of the “very latest
thing” in Continental authors. Few of us have
read Kolniyatch in “the original Gibrisch,” but
Mr. Beerbohm’s description of his work and personality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
makes it clear that he was an author compared
with whom Dostoievsky and Strindberg
were serene and saccharine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the man himself—for on several occasions I had
the privilege and the permit to visit him—I have the
pleasantest, most sacred memories. His was a wonderfully
vivid and intense personality. The head was
beautiful, perfectly conic in form. The eyes were like
two revolving lamps, set very close together. The smile
was haunting. There was a touch of old-world courtesy
in the repression of the evident impulse to spring at one’s
throat.</p>
</div>

<p>After this comes “No. 2, The Pines”—yes, this
is Mr. Beerbohm’s masterpiece, too. Everybody
writes well about Swinburne, but Mr. Beerbohm
writes better than anybody else—better, if possible,
even than Mr. Lucas. What other writer
could drive respect and mockery tandem with the
same delicate skill? Mr. Beerbohm sees the
famous Putney household not only with the comic
sense, but through the eyes of a literary youth
introduced for the first time into the presence of
immortals. The Pines may be a Lewis-Carroll
Wonderland, but it is still a wonderland, as he
recalls that first meal at the end of the long table—“Watts-Dunton
between us very low down
over his plate, very cosy and hirsute, and rather
like the Dormouse at that long tea-table which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Alice found in Wonderland. I see myself sitting
there wide-eyed, as Alice sat. And, had the
Hare been a great poet, and the Hatter a great
gentleman, and neither of them mad but each
one only very odd and vivacious, I might see
Swinburne as a glorified blend of those two.”</p>

<p>“A Letter that Was Not Written,” again, is
a comedy of the arts, relating to the threatened
destruction of the Adelphi. “Books within
Books” is a charming speculation on books written
by characters in fiction, not the least desirable
of which, surely, was “Poments: Being Poems
of the Mood and the Moment”—a work that
made a character in a forgotten novel deservedly
famous. The next essay, “The Golden Drugget,”
may seem by its subject—the beam of light
that falls from an open inn-door on a dark night—to
be outside the literary-and-artistic formula,
but is it not essentially an argument with artists
that the old themes are best—that this “golden
drugget” of light would somehow make a better
picture than Smithkins’ <i>Façade of the Waldorf
Hotel by Night, in Peace Time</i>? Similarly,
“Hosts and Guests,” though it takes us perilously
near the borderland of lay humanity, is essentially
a literary causerie. Mr. Beerbohm may
write on hosts and describe the pangs of an impoverished
host in one of the “more distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
restaurants” as he waits and wonders what the
amount of the bill will be; but the principal hosts
and hostesses of whom he writes are Jael and
Circe and Macbeth and Old Wardle. “A Point
to be Remembered by Very Eminent Men,” the
essay that follows, contains advice to great
authors as to how they should receive a worshipper
who is to meet them for the first time.
The author should not, Mr. Beerbohm thinks, be
in the room to receive him, but should keep him
waiting a little, though not so long as Leigh
Hunt kept young Coventry Patmore, who had
been kicking his heels for two hours when his
host appeared “rubbing his hands and smiling
ethereally, and saying, without a word of preface
or notice of my having waited so long, ‘This is a
beautiful world, Mr. Patmore!’”</p>

<p>There is no need to make the proof of the
literary origins of “Max” more detailed. The
world that he sees in the mirror of literature
means more to Mr. Beerbohm than the world itself
that is mirrored. The only human figure
that attracts him greatly is the man who holds the
mirror up. He does not look in his heart and
write. He looks in the glass and writes. The
parts of nature and art, as Landor gave them,
will have to be reversed for Mr. Beerbohm’s
epitaph. For him, indeed, nature seems hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
to exist. For him no birds sing, and he probably
thinks that the scarlet pimpernel was invented
by Baroness Orczy. His talent is urban
and, in a good sense, prosaic. He has never
ceased to be a dramatic critic, indeed, observing
the men created by men (and the creators of those
men) rather than the men created by God. He
is a spectator, and a spectator inside four walls.
He is, indeed, the last of the æsthetes. His
æstheticism, however, is comic æstheticism. If
he writes an unusual word, it is not to stir our
imaginations with its beauty, but as a kind of
dandyism, reminding us of the care with which
he dresses his wit.</p>

<p>Within his own little world—so even the devil’s
advocate would have to end by admitting—Mr.
Beerbohm is a master. He has done a small
thing perfectly, and one perfect quip will outlive
ten bad epics. It is not to be wondered at that
people already see the first hint of wings sprouting
from his supremely well-tailored shoulders.
He is, indeed, as immortal as anybody alive. He
will flit through eternity, not as an archangel,
perhaps, but as a mischievous cherub in a silk
hat. He is cherub enough already always to be
on the side of the angels. Those who declared
that he had a heart were not mistaken. There is
at least one note of tenderness in the peal of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
mockery. There is a spirit of courtesy and considerateness
in his writing, noticeable alike in
“No. 2, The Pines,” and in the essay on servants.
Thus, though he writes mainly on the arts and
artists, he sees in them, not mere figures of ornament,
but figures of life, and expresses through
them clearly enough—I was going to say his
attitude to life. He is no parasite at the table of
the arts, indeed, but a guest with perfect manners,
at once shy and brilliant, one who never
echoes an opinion dully, but is always amusingly
himself. That accounts for his charm. Perfect
manners in literature are rare nowadays. Many
authors are either pretending or condescending,
either malicious or suspicious. “Max” has all
the virtues of egotism without any of its vices.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. ARNOLD BENNETT CONFESSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Bennett is at once a connoisseur and a card.
He not only knows things but has an air of
knowing things. He lets you know that he is
“in the know.” He has a taking way of giving
information as though it were inside information.
He is the man of genius as tipster. In <i>Things
That Have Interested Me</i> he gives us tips about
painting, music, literature, acting, war, politics,
manners and morals. He never hesitates: even
when he is hinting about the future, he seems to
do it with a nod that implies, “You may take my
word for it.” There was never a less speculative
author. Mr. Wells precipitates himself into
eternity or the twenty-first century in search of
things that really matter. Mr. Bennett is
equally inquisitive, but he is inquisitive in a
different way and almost entirely about his own
time. Where Mr. Wells speculates, Mr. Bennett
finds out, and, “when found, makes a note.”
He gives one the impression of a man with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
passion for buttonholing experts. He could interest
himself for a time in any expert—an expert
footballer or an expert Civil Servant or an expert
violinist or an expert washerwoman. He likes
to see the wheels of contemporary life—even the
smallest wheel—at work, and to learn the secrets
of the machine. His attitude to life is suggested
by the fact that he has written a book called
<i>The Human Machine</i>, and that it is inconceivable
that he should write a book called <i>The Human
Soul</i>. This is not to deny Mr. Bennett’s
vivid imaginative interest in things. It is merely
to point out that it is the interest not of a mystic
but of a contemporary note-taker. That is the
circle within which his genius works, and it is a
genius without a rival of its kind in the literature
of our time. He pursues his facts with something
of the appetite of a Boswell, though more
temperately. He has common sense where Boswell
was a fool, however. Mr. Bennett, finding
that even a glass of champagne and, perhaps, a
spoonful of brandy taken regularly had the effect
of clogging his “own particular machine,” decided
to drink no alcohol at all. Boswell might
have taken the same decision, but he could not
have kept to it. Mr. Bennett, none the less, is as
fantastic in his common sense as was Boswell in
his folly. Each of them is a fantastic buttonholer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
It is this element in him that raises Mr.
Bennett so high above all the other more or less
realistic writers of his time.</p>

<p><i>Things That Have Interested Me</i> is a book of
confessions that could have been written by no
other living man. His style—perky, efficient,
decisive—is the echo of a personality. What
other critic of the arts would express his enthusiasm
for great painting just like this?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was fortunate for Turner that Girtin died early.
He might have knocked spots off Turner. And, while
I am about the matter, I may as well say that I doubt
whether Turner was well advised in having his big oil-paintings
hung alongside of Claude’s in the National
Gallery. The ordeal was the least in the world too
severe for them. Still, I would not deny that Turner
was a very great person.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Such a paragraph, with its rapid series of terse
judgments, is defiantly interesting. It is not
only the “You may take it from me” attitude
that fascinates us: it is the “me” from whom you
may take it. It is an excited “me” as well as a
cocksure “me.” Mr. Bennett is an enthusiast, as
you may see when, writing of Brabazon, he
affirms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In my opinion his “Taj Mahal” is the finest water-colour
<i>sketch</i> ever done. He probably did it in about
a quarter of an hour.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p class="in0">Or, turning to literature, he will tell you:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Similarly will a bond be created if you ask a man
where is the finest modern English prose and he replies:
“In <i>The Revolution in Tanner’s Lane</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bennett is always hunting the superlative.
He wants the best of everything, and he won’t
be happy till he tells you where you can get it.
It is true that he says: “Let us all thank God
that there is no ‘best short story.’” But that is
only because there are several, and Mr. Bennett,
one suspects, knows them all. “I am not sure,”
he says on this point, “that any short stories in
English can qualify for the championship.” Yet
I fancy the editor of a collection of the world’s
best short stories would have to consider a good
deal of Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wells’s <i>Country of the
Blind</i>, and Mr. Bennett’s own <i>Matador of the
Five Towns</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett’s chase of the superlative is not
confined to the arts. He demands superlative
qualities even in barbers. He has submitted his
head to barbers in many of the countries of
Europe, and he gives the first prize to the Italians.
“Italian barbers,” he declares, “are greater
than French, both in quality and in numbers.”
At the same time, taking barbers not in nations
but as individuals, he tells us: “The finest artist I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
know or have known is nevertheless in Paris.
His life has the austerity of a monk’s.” Judging
them by nations, he gives Denmark a “highly
commended”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I like Denmark because there some of the barbers’
shops have a thin ascending jet of water whose summit
just caresses the bent chin, which, after shaving, is thus
laved without either the repugnant British sponge or the
clumsy splashing practised in France and Italy.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">He knows about it all: he knows; he knows.
And, knowing so much, he is in all the better
position to censure a certain British barber who
parted his hair on the wrong side:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When he came back he parted my hair on the wrong
side—sure sign of an inefficient barber. He had been
barbering for probably twenty years and had not learnt
that a barber ought to notice the disposition of a customer’s
hair before touching it. He was incapable, but not
a bad sort.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And Mr. Bennett, even though he is perilously
near being a teetotaller, can discourse to you as
learnedly on drinks as on ways of getting your
hair cut. “Not many men,” he says, “can talk
intelligently about drink, but far more can talk
intelligently about drink than about food.” He
himself is one of the number, as witness:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was only one wine at that dinner, Bollinger,
1911, a wine that will soon be extinct. It was perfect,
as perfect as the cigars.... We decided that no
champagne could beat it, even if any could equal it,
and I once again abandoned the belief, put into me by
certain experts, that the finest 1911 champagnes were
Krug and Duc de Montebello.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">One of the especial charms of Mr. Bennett as a
writer is that he talks about painters and barbers,
about champagne and short stories, in exactly the
same tone and with the same seriousness, and
measures them, so far as one can see, by the same
standard. Indeed, he discusses epic poetry in
terms of food.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All great epics are full of meat and are juicy side-dishes,
if only people will refrain from taking them as
seriously as porridge. <i>Paradise Lost</i> is a whole picnic
menu, and its fragments make first-rate light reading.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">To write like this is to give effect of paradox,
even when one is talking common sense. It is
clear that Mr. Bennett does it deliberately. He
does it as an efficient artist, not as a bungler.
He fishes for our interest with a conscious <i>gaucherie</i>
of phrase, as when he ends his reference to
the novels of Henry James with the sentence:
“They lack ecstasy, guts.”</p>

<p>One of the most amusing passages in the book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
is that in which Mr. Bennett leaves us with a
portrait of himself as artist in contrast to Henry
James, the writer of “pot-boilers.” It hardly
needs saying that in doing this Mr. Bennett is
making no extravagant claims for himself, but is
merely getting in a cunning retort to some of
his “highbrow” critics. The comparison between
his own case and that of James refers only to one
point, and arises from the fact that James wrote
plays with the sole object of making money. On
this Mr. Bennett comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Somebody of realistic temperament ought to have
advised James that to write plays with the sole object
of making money is a hopeless enterprise. I tried it
myself for several years, at the end of which I abandoned
the stage for ever. I should not have returned to it,
had not Lee Mathews of the Stage Society persuaded
me to write a play in the same spirit as I was writing
novels. It was entirely due to him that I wrote <i>Cupid
and Commonsense</i>. Since then I have never written a
play except for my own artistic satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Nor, one feels, did he write even the casual
jottings on life and the arts in <i>Things that Have
Interested Me</i> for any other reason than that it
pleased him to do it. The jottings vary in
quality from ephemeral social and political comment
to sharply-realised accounts of “things
seen,” vivid notes of self-analysis, confessions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the tastes and experiences of an epicure of life
with a strong preference for leaving the world
better than he found it. Mr. Bennett gives us
here a jigsaw portrait of himself. We can reconstruct
it from the bits—a man shy and
omniscient, simple and ostentatious, Beau Nash
from the Five Towns.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. CONRAD AT HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Conrad is nothing of a peacock. You may
stare at him as long as you like, but he will never
respond with a sudden spread of gorgeous
vanities. He is more like some bird that takes
on the protective colouring of the earth and delights
in avoiding rather than in attracting the
prying eye. Flatter him as you will; call him a
phœnix or a bird of paradise: he may be secretly
pleased but he will only croak gruffly in reply,
“To have the gift of words is no such great
matter.” He does not know how to play up to
our inquisitive admiration. We may think, as
when we take up <i>A Personal Record</i>, that now
at last we have caught him in a position in which
he is bound to show us his fine feathers. But it
is a vain hope. Glimpses we get—amazing
glimpses—but never the near and detailed spectacle
we desire. He protests that he is no cynic,
but is he sure that he does not find a cynical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
amusement in tantalising our curiosity? Otherwise,
would he have written in the preface to
<i>Notes on Life and Letters</i> that “perhaps it will
do something to help towards a better vision of
the man, if it gives no more than a partial view
of a piece of his back, a little dusty (after the
process of tidying-up), a little bowed, and receding
from the world not because of weariness or
misanthropy, but for other reasons that cannot
be helped”? It may be that Mr. Conrad can
suggest more enticing mysteries by a portrait of
a piece of an author’s back than other writers can
by a full-length representation, showing the
polish on the boots and the crease in the trousers.
In art the half (or very much less) is greater than
the whole. Still, Mr. Conrad’s principal object
in showing us the back is that it may leave us
unsatisfied and speculating. He does not intend
to satisfy us. It is as though he had written
on the title-page of his autobiography: “Thus
far and no further.”</p>

<p>At the same time, if he tells little about himself,
he does not escape giving himself away in
his admiration for other men. He has an artistic
faith that breaks into his sentences as soon as
he begins to talk of Henry James or Maupassant
or Turgenev. Not that he belongs to any school
in literature: he hates all references to schools.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
He becomes sullenly hostile if anyone attempts
to classify authors as romantics, realists, naturalists,
etc. Every great author is for him a man,
not a formula. He can hardly mention the word
“formula” without disgust. “No secret of
eternal life for our books,” he declares, “can be
found among the formulas of art, any more than
for our bodies in a prescribed combination of
drugs.” Again, “the truth is, that more than one
kind of intellectual cowardice hides behind the
literary formulas.” And once more, in speaking
of the good artist: “It is in the impartial practice
of life, if anywhere, that the promise of
perfection for his art can be found, rather than
in the absurd formulas trying to prescribe this
or that particular method of technique or conception.”
This may suggest to the pedantic that
Mr. Conrad has no critical standards, and he
certainly prefers to portray an author rather
than to measure him with a tape as if for a suit
of clothes. And he is right; for to portray an
author truthfully is to measure him in a far
profounder sense than can be done with a tape
run round his waist, and down the side of his
leg. Mr. Conrad’s quest is the soul of his author.
If it be a noble soul, he has a welcome for it, as
Plutarch had in his biographies. He may not
agree with Maupassant’s deterministic view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
life, but he salutes Maupassant in passing with
the remark: “The worth of every conviction consists
precisely in the steadfastness with which
it is held.” His first demand of an author is
truth—not absolute truth, but the truth that is
in him. “At the heart of fiction,” he declares,
“even the least worthy of the name, some sort of
truth can be found—if only the truth of a childish
theatrical ardour in the game of life, as in the
novels of Dumas the father.”</p>

<p>Mr. Conrad, indeed, claims for fiction that it
is nearer truth than history, agreeing more or
less on this point with Aristotle and Schopenhauer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fiction is history, human history, or it is nothing.
But it is also more than that; it stands on firmer ground,
being based on the reality of forms and the observation
of social phenomena, whereas history is based on
documents, and the reading of print and handwriting—on
second-hand impression. Thus fiction is nearer
truth. But let that pass. An historian may be an artist,
too, and a novelist is an historian, the preserver, the
keeper, the expounder, of human experience.</p>
</div>

<p>I confess I dislike this contention among the
various literary forms—poetry, fiction, history,
biography, drama and essay—as to which of them
is nearest grace. It is not the form that seizes
the truth, but the imagination of the artist working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
through the form. Imagination and the
sense of life are as necessary to a good historian
as to a good novelist. Artists need not quarrel
for precedence for any particular art in a world
in which all the great books that have so far been
written could be packed into a little room. At
the same time, it is well that a novelist should
take his art as seriously as Aristotle took the art
of poetry. It often requires an exaggeration to
bring the truth into prominence. And, in any
case, the exaggerations of the novelists in this
respect have as a rule been modest compared to
the exaggerations of the poets.</p>

<p>If Mr. Conrad is to be believed, however, the
novelist is the rival, not only of the historian,
but of the moralist. He warmly denies that he is
a didactic writer, but at least he holds that in
all great fiction a moral is implicit that he who
runs may read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That a sacrifice must be made, that something has
to be given up, is the truth engraved in the innermost
recesses of the fair temple built for our edification by
the masters of fiction. There is no other secret behind
the curtain. All adventure, all love, every success is
resumed in the supreme energy of an act of renunciation.</p>
</div>

<p>One would have to think hard in order to fit
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> and <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
this—if the word is not forbidden—formula.
Perhaps it is a formula more applicable to tragic
than to comic writing. Mr. Conrad as critic
often seems to be defining his own art rather than
the art of fiction in general. He knows what he
himself is aiming at in literature, and he looks
for the same fine purpose in his fellow-writers.
We feel this when he requires of the novelist
“many acts of faith of which the first would be
the cherishing of an undying hope.” This, he
declares, “is the God-sent form of trust in the
magic force and inspiration belonging to the life
of this earth.” “To be hopeful in an artistic
sense,” he adds, “it is not necessary to think that
the world is good. It is enough to believe that
there is no impossibility of its being made so.”
There surely speaks the author of <i>Youth</i> and
<i>Typhoon</i>. And the image of the same author
may be seen in the remark that “I would ask
that in his dealings with mankind he”—the
novelist—“should be capable of giving a tender
recognition to their obscure virtues.” Mr. Conrad
cannot escape from the shadow of his own
genius. It falls on every page of his criticism
as fatally as any formula, though more vividly.
His protest against what has been called “stylism”
is simply the protest of one who did not
approach the art of literature through that door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
He is praising not merely Maupassant but his
ideal self when he tells us:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His proceeding was not to group expressive words,
that mean nothing, around misty and mysterious shapes
dear to muddled intellects and belonging neither to earth
nor to heaven. His vision by a more scrupulous, prolonged
and devoted attention to the aspects of the visible
world, discovered at last the right words as if miraculously
impressed for him upon the face of things and
events.</p>
</div>

<p>That, no doubt, is how Mr. Conrad learned the
art of writing, and we may read autobiography
into his praise of Maupassant again when he
says: “He stoops to no littleness in his art—least
of all to the miserable vanity of a catchy phrase.”
But his appreciation of Maupassant, though
admirable in so far as it defines certain qualities
in his own and Maupassant’s work, is worded in
a manner that savours of intolerance of the work
of many other good writers, from Shakespeare to
Dickens and, if one may include a more Lilliputian
artist, Stevenson. Thus he observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He will not be led into perdition by the seductions of
sentiment, of eloquence, of humour, pathos; of all that
splendid pageant of faults that pass between the writer
and his probity on the blank sheet of paper, like the
glittering cortège of deadly sins before the austere
anchorite in the desert air of the Thebaïde.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>Maupassant’s austerity may have been an
excellent thing for Maupassant, but to write like
this is surely to reduce austerity to the level of a
formula. That “splendid pageant of faults”
may well be the salvation of another writer. We
may admit that they remain faults unless they
fit in as organic parts of a writer’s work. But
Maupassant was a smaller, not a greater, writer
in so far as he was unable so to fit them in.</p>

<p>It would be going too far to suggest, however,
that Mr. Conrad merely emphasises in other
writers those qualities which he himself either
possesses or desires to possess. Most good portraits
are double portraits: they portray both the
painter and the sitter. Mr. Conrad always does
justice to his sitter, as when he writes: “Henry
James is the historian of fine consciences,” or as
when he says of Maupassant: “It cannot be denied
that he thinks very little. In him extreme
energy of perception achieves great results, as in
men of action the energy of force and desire.”
At the same time, we read <i>Notes on Life and
Letters</i> for the light it throws, not on this or that
author or the Polish question or the question of
unsinkable ships, but on Mr. Conrad himself.
The essay on Anatole France, for instance, interests
us mainly because it reminds us that Mr.
Conrad is as impatient of political panaceas as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
of literary formulas. Remembering that Anatole
France is a Socialist, he observes characteristically:
“He will disregard the stupidity of the
dogma and the unlovely form of the ideal. His
art will find its own beauty in the imaginative
presentation of wrongs, of errors, and miseries
that call aloud for redress.” He commands the
artist to hope, but he clearly forbids anybody
to hope too much. His “Note on the Polish Problem”
shows that during the war the most he
hoped for his country was an Anglo-French protectorate.
Humanitarians horrify him with their
dreams. He hates impossibilism as he hates the
talk about unsinkable ships. But what he really
hates most, both in politics and in ships, is the
blind worship of machinery. He looks on Socialism,
I fancy, as an attempt on the part of
machine-worshippers to build an unsinkable
State—a monstrous political <i>Titanic</i>, defiant of
the facts of nature and fore-doomed to catastrophe.
And how this old master of a sailing-ship
hates the <i>Titanic</i>! He has little that is good to
say, indeed, of any steam vessels, at least of
cargo steam vessels—“a suggestion of a low
parody directed at noble predecessors by an
improved generation of dull mechanical toilers,
conceited and without grace.” Progress? He
retorts: “The tinning of salmon was ‘progress.’”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
And yet, when he met the men of the merchant
service during the war, he had to admit that “men
don’t change.” That is a fact at once reassuring
and depressing. It is reassuring to know that
human beings, if they avoid the sin of idolaters,
can make use of machines with reasonable safety.
The machine, like the literary formula, is a convenience.
Even the Socialist State would be only
a convenience. It would in all probability be
very little more alarming than a button-hook or
a lead pencil.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. WELLS AND THE WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Wells is in love with the human race. It is
one of the rarest of passions. It is a passion of
which not even all imaginative men are capable.
It was, perhaps, the grandest of Shelley’s grand
passions, and it was the demon in William
Morris’s breast. On the other hand, it played
a small part if any, in the lives of Shakespeare
and Dickens. Their kaleidoscopic sympathy with
human beings was at the antipodes from Shelley’s
angelic infatuation with the human race. The
distinction has often been commented on. It is
the difference between affection and prophecy.
There is no reason, I suppose, why the two things
should not be combined, and, indeed, there have
been affectionate prophets both among the religious
teachers and among men of letters. But,
as a rule, one element flourishes at the expense of
the other, and Charles Lamb would have been
as incapable of even wishing to write the <i>Outline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of History</i> as Mr. Wells would be of attempting
to write the <i>Essays of Elia</i>.</p>

<p>Not that Mr. Wells gives us the impression
that he loves men in general more than Charles
Lamb did. It seems almost as if he loved the
destiny of man more than he loves man himself.
His hero is an anonymous two-legged creature
who was born thousands of years ago and has been
reincarnated innumerable times and who will go
on being re-born until he has established the
foundations of order amid the original slime of
things. That is the character in history whom
Mr. Wells most sincerely loves. He means
more to him than Moses or any of Plutarch’s
men. Plutarch’s men, indeed, are for the most
part men who might have served man but
preferred to take advantage of him. Compare
Plutarch’s and Mr. Wells’s treatment of Cato
the Elder and Julius Cæsar, and you will see
the difference between sympathy with individual
men and passion for the purpose of man.
You will see the same difference if you compare
the Bible we possess with the new Bible
of which Mr. Wells draws up a syllabus in
<i>The Salvaging of Civilisation</i>. The older book
at the outset hardly pauses to deal with man
as a generalisation, but launches almost at once
into the story of one man called Adam and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
woman called Eve. Mr. Wells, on the other
hand, would begin the human part of his narrative
with “the story of our race”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How through hundreds of thousands of years it won
power over nature, hunted and presently sowed and
reaped. How it learnt the secrets of metals, mastered
the riddle of the seasons, and took to the seas. That
story of our common inheritance and of our slow upward
struggle has to be taught throughout our entire community
in the city slums and in the out-of-the-way farmsteads
most of all. By teaching it, we restore again to
our people the lost basis of a community, a common
idea of their place in space and time.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Wells’s attitude to men, it is clear, is primarily
that of a philosopher, while the attitude
of the Bible is primarily that of a poet. It remains
to be seen whether a philosopher’s Bible
can move the common imagination as the older
Bible has moved it. That it can move and excite
it in some degree we know. We have only to
read the glowing pages with which <i>The Salvaging
of Civilisation</i> opens in order to realise this.
Mr. Wells’s passion for the human group is infectious.
He expresses it with the vehemence
of a great preacher. He plays, like many great
preachers, not on our sympathy so much as on
our hopes and fears. His book is a book of
salvation and damnation—of warnings to flee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
from the wrath to come, of prophecies of swords
turned into ploughshares and spears into pruning-hooks.
He loves his ideal group-man almost
as Bunyan loved Christian. He offers him, it
is true, at the end of his journey, not Paradise,
but the World-State. He offers it to him,
moreover, not as an individual but as a type.
He bids men be ready to perish in order that
man may arrive at the goal. His book is a call
to personal sacrifice to the end, not of personal,
but of general salvation. That, however, is an
appeal that has again and again been proved
effective in history. It is of the same kind as the
appeal of patriotism in time of war. “Who dies
if England lives?” sang Mr. Kipling. “Who
dies if the World-State lives?” Mr. Wells retorts.</p>

<p>The question remains whether the ordinary
man can ever be brought to think of the world
as a thing worth living and dying for as he has
often thought his country worth living and dying
for. If the world were attacked by the inhabitants
of another planet, world-patriotism would
become a necessity of self-defence, and the peoples
of the world would be presented with the
alternatives of uniting or perishing. Mr. Wells
believes, no doubt, that they are presented with
these alternatives already. But can they be
made to realise this by anything but an external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
enemy? It is external enemies that create and
intensify patriotism. Can human beings as a
whole organise themselves against war as the
enemy with the same thoroughness with which
Englishmen organised themselves against Germany
as the enemy? Mr. Wells obviously
believes that they can. But it is to the great religions,
not to the great patriotisms, that he looks
for examples of how this can be done. He
recalls how the Christian religion spread in the
first four centuries and how the Moslem religion
spread in the seventh century, and he
believes that these precedents “support a reasonable
hope that such a change in the minds
of men, whatever else it may be, is a practicable
change.” His gospel of human brotherhood,
indeed, is propounded as a larger Christianity
rather than as a larger patriotism. He realises,
however, the immensity of the difficulties in the
way of the spread of this gospel. He sees that
the majority of men are still indifferent to it.
Unless they are in the vein for it, “it does not
really interest them; rather it worries them.”
That is why he believes so ardently in the need
of a new Bible—a Bible of Civilisation—which
will restore to modern men “a sense of personal
significance, a sense of destiny, such as no one
in politics or literature seems to possess to-day.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
That is why he scorns such a compromise and
concession to the frailty of human nature as a
League of Nations and calls on men to turn
their eyes from all such conveniences and makeshifts
and to concentrate on the more arduous
ideal of human unity. Of the League of Nations
he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The praise has a thin and legal and litigious flavour.
What loyalty and what devotion can we expect this
multiple association to command? It has no unity—no
personality. It is like asking a man to love the average
member of a woman’s club instead of loving his wife.</p>

<p>For the idea of man, for human unity, for our common
blood, for the one order of the world, I can imagine
men living and dying, but not for a miscellaneous
assembly that will not mix—even in its name. It has no
central idea, no heart to it, this League of Nations
formula.</p>

<p>Many people will agree with much of Mr.
Wells’s scornful criticism of the League of Nations.
He is obviously writing the plainest
common sense when he declares that it has failed
so far to solve the problem of modifying the traditional
idea of sovereign independence and the
problem of a super-national force that will be
stronger than any national force. The average
statesman is still an Imperialist at heart, even
when he praises the League of Nations with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
lips. He desires a world-order that will confirm
the present order of rival Empires rather than
a world-order that will supersede it. He desires
to avert war, but only if he may preserve all
the conditions that make war inevitable. Mr.
Wells is impatient of all this as a treachery to
the greatest ideal that has come into the world
in our time. On the other hand, I think that
the advocates of the League of Nations and not
the advocates of the World State are going the
right way to propagate the sense of world-unity
that Mr. Wells desires. The League of Nations,
whatever its shortcomings, does make
human nature a partner in its ideal. It remembers
the ordinary human being’s affection for
his own country, and does not treat it as a mere
prejudice in the path. It realises that the true
victory of internationalism will be not as the
destroyer of individualism but as its counterweight.
It used to be thought that a man could
not be loyal to both his church and his country
unless the Church were a State Church. Some
Socialists have believed that the family and the
State were inevitable rivals. As a matter of fact,
every man is in a state of balance among conflicting
loyalties—loyalty to himself, to the
family, to the school, to the Church, to the State,
to the world. The religion of the brotherhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
of man must bow to this fact, or it must fail.
To ignore it is to be a doctrinaire—to fail, that
is, to bring home one’s doctrine to men’s business
and bosoms. It is to sit above the battle
so far as the immediate issues with which mankind
is faced are concerned. Mr. Wells has
rendered an immense service to his time by compelling
us to remember the common origin and
the common interests of mankind. He has invented
a wonderful telescope through which we
can look back and see man struggling out of the
mud and can look forward and see him climbing
a dim and distant pinnacle. I am not sure,
however, if he has pointed out the most desirable
route to the pinnacle—whether he does not
expect us to reach it as the crow flies instead of
by winding roads and by bridges across the
deep rivers and ravines. He may take the view
that, as man has learned to fly mechanically, so
he may learn to fly politically. One never knows.
The glorious feature of his prophetic writing,
meanwhile, is its driving-force. He is one of
the few writers who have given momentum to
the idea of the world as one place.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. CLUTTON-BROCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Clutton-Brock is a critic with an unusual
equality of interests. He seems to be the centre
of an almost perfect circle, and literature, painting,
religion, philosophy, ethics, and education
are the all but equal radii that connect him with
the circumference. Many writers have been as
versatile, but few have been as symmetrical.
He has all his gifts in due proportion. He is
not more æsthetic than moral, or more moral
than æsthetic. His idealism and his intellect
balance each other exactly. His matter and his
manner are twins. He produces on us the effect
of a harmony, not of a nature in conflict with
itself. Had he lived in the ancient world, he
would probably have been a teacher of philosophy.
He has gifts of temper as well as powers
of exposition and understanding that make him
a teacher even to-day, whether he will or not.
He does not speak down to us from the chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
but he is at our elbows murmuring with exquisite
restraint yet with an eagerness only half-hidden
the “nothing too much” of the Greeks, the
“Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty” of Keats, the
good news that the flesh and spirit are not enemies
but friends, and that the Earth for the
wise man is not at odds with Paradise.</p>

<p>Those who shrink from virtue as from a split
infinitive sometimes speak in disparagement of
Mr. Clutton-Brock’s gifts. He is the head of
a table at which the virtues and the graces sit
down side by side, and they are dressed so much
alike that it is not always easy to tell which is
which. He is always seeking, indeed, the point
at which a virtue passes into a grace, and he knits
his brows over those extreme differences that
separate one from the other. The standard by
which he measures things in literature and in
life is an ideal world in which goodness and
beauty answer one another in antiphonal music.
His ideal man is the <i>kalos k’ agathos</i> of ancient
Athens. He goes among authors in quest of
this part-song in their work. He misses it in
the later Tolstoy: he discovers it in Marvell and
Vaughan. He is not to be put off, however,
with a forced and unnatural antiphony. He is
critical of the antiphony of body and soul that
announces “All’s well!” in Whitman’s verse. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
finds in Whitman not organic cheerfulness but
functional cheerfulness—“willed cheerfulness,”
he calls it. And he says of Whitman with penetrating
wisdom: “He was a man not strong
enough in art or in life to do without that willed
cheerfulness; it is for him a defence like irony,
though a newer, more democratic, more American
defence.” He writes with equal wisdom when
he says that Whitman “has got a great part of
his popularity from those who were grateful to
him for saying so firmly and so often what they
wished to believe.” But might not this be said
of all poets of hope? Might it not be said of
Shelley and of Browning? I am not sure, indeed,
that Mr. Clutton-Brock does not do
serious injustice to Whitman in exaggerating
the element of reaction in him against old fears
as well as old forms. His discovery of the secret
of what is false in Whitman has partly blinded
him to the secret of what is true. Otherwise, how
could he ask us whether there is anything in
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> that moves us as we are moved
by Edgar Allan Poe’s <i>The Sleeper</i>? Can he have
forgotten <i>Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking</i>,
to name but one of Whitman’s profoundly moving
poems? Mr. Clutton-Brock does, indeed,
end his essay with fine if tempered praise of
Whitman’s genius. But his essay as a whole is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
a question-mark, expressing a doubt of something
false, something even “faked.”</p>

<p>His essay on Poe is more sympathetic. He
finds in Poe, not a false harmony, but a real discord—a
pitiable discord. “There was a fatal
separation,” we are told, “between his intellect
and his emotions, except in a very few of his
poems, because he could not value life or human
nature in comparison with the life and the nature
of that other planet for which he was homesick.
So he exercised his intellect on games, but with
a thwarted passion which gives a surprising interest
and beauty even to his detective stories.”
This is well said, but, as we read the essay, we
become aware of a curious ultra-fastidiousness
in Mr. Clutton-Brock—a lack of vulgarity, in
the best sense of the word. We see this in his
attitude to Poe’s most popular work; he dismisses
<i>The Raven</i> and <i>The Bells</i> as “fit to be
recited at penny readings.” That certainly has
been their fate, but it does not prevent them
from being masterpieces in their kind—the <i>jeux
d’esprit</i> of a planet-struck man. They are not,
however, we may admit, the poems that reveal
Poe as an inspired writer. It is a much more
serious thing for Mr. Clutton-Brock to omit
<i>Annabel Lee</i> from the list of the six poems or so,
on which Poe’s reputation as a poet rests. <i>Annabel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Lee</i> is a work of genius, if Poe ever wrote
a work of genius. <i>Helen, Thy Beauty is to Me</i>—which
has none of its faults—is the only one
of his poems that challenges its supremacy, perhaps
successfully. Mr. Clutton-Brock’s essay
on the other hand, will be of service to the general
reader if it gives him the feeling that Poe is to
be approached, not as a hackneyed author, but
as a writer of undiscovered genius. He does
not exaggerate the beauty of <i>The Sleeper</i>, though
he exaggerates its place in Poe’s work. The
truth is, Poe is a neglected poet. The average
reader regards him as too well known to be worth
reading, and <i>The Sleeper</i>, <i>The City in the Sea</i>
and <i>Romance</i> are ignored because <i>The Bells</i> has
fallen into the hands of popular reciters.</p>

<p>Mr. Clutton-Brock has the happy gift of taking
his readers into the presence of most of his
authors in the spirit of discoverers. It is not
that he aims at originality or paradox. He is
always primarily in search of truth, even when
he gets on a false scent. His essay on Meredith
is a series of interesting guesses at truth, some
of which are extremely suggestive, and some of
which seem to me to miss the mark. The most
suggestive is the remark that <i>Love in the Valley</i>
is not only written on “a theme that inspired the
music of the first folk-songs,” but that the verse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
itself has “for its underlying tune” a folk-measure—the
old Saturnian measure of the Romans.
Macaulay, it may be remembered, was startled
to learn that his ballad of “brave Horatius” was
written largely in the Saturnian metre, and still
more startled when he was unable to find any
perfect example of this metre in English verse,
except:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Queen was in her parlour, eating bread and honey.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It comes as something of a shock to be told that
the <span class="locked">lines—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">are musically akin to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lars Porsena of Clusium,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the nine gods he swore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And Mr. Clutton-Brock would be the last man
to pretend that it is the same music we find in
both. Meredith’s variations on the old tune are,
he makes clear, as important a part of the music
as is the old tune itself. “It is folk-song with
the modern orchestra like the symphonies of
Dvorák, and it combines a singing rhythm with
sharpness and fullness of detail as they had never
before been combined in romantic poetry.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Criticism like this is not merely a comment on
technique; it is a guess of the spirit, emphasising
the primitive and universal elements which make
<i>Love in the Valley</i> probably the most enduring
of Meredith’s works.</p>

<p>I do not think Mr. Clutton-Brock is so happy
when he writes of Meredith as a novelist. He
goes too far when he suggests that Meredith’s
witty characters, or mouthpieces, are “always
subsidiary and often unpleasant,” like the wise
youth in <i>Richard Feverel</i>. Meredith, he declares,
“does not think much of these witty characters
that he cannot do without.” He “would
never make a hero more witty than he could help,
for he likes his heroes to be either men of action
or delightful youths whom too much cleverness
would spoil. He himself was not in love with
cleverness, and never aimed at it.” This is only
partly true. It is partly true in regard to Meredith’s
men, and not true at all in regard to his
women. <i>Diana of the Crossways</i> alone is enough
to disprove it. Meredith’s heroes were conventions;
his heroines were creations; and he liked
his creations to be witty. He loved wit as his
natural air. His <i>Essay on Comedy</i> is a witty
dithyramb in praise of wit. Mr. Clutton-Brock
seems to me to make another mistake in regard
to Meredith when he says that “if he had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
less genius, less power of speech, less understanding
of men, he might have been an essayist.”
As a matter of fact, Merdith was too proud to
be an essayist. There are no proud essayists,
though many vain ones. Mr. Belloc is the nearest
thing to a proud essayist that one can think
of, and his pride is really only a fascinating
arrogance.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Mr. Clutton-Brock excites
to controversy, as every good critic who attempts
a new analysis of an author’s genius must do.
Were there space, I should like to dispute many
points in his essay, “The Defects of English
Prose,” in which, incidentally, he accepts the
current over-estimate of the prose—the excellent
prose—of Mr. Hudson. The purpose of criticism,
however, is to raise questions as much as
to answer them, and this Mr. Clutton-Brock
continually does in his thoughtful analysis of the
success and failure of great writers. He is an
expositor with high standards in life and literature,
who worships beauty in the temple of reason.
His essays, though slight in form, are rich
in matter. They are fragments of a philosophy
as well as comments on authors.</p>

<span class="subhead">HENLEY THE VAINGLORIOUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Henley was a master of the vainglorious phrase.
He was Pistol with a style. He wrote in order to
be overheard. His words were sturdy vagabonds,
bawling and swaggering. “Let us be
drunk,” he cried in one of his <i>rondeaux</i>, and he
made his words exultant as with wine.</p>

<p>He saw everywhere in Nature the images of
the lewd population of midnight streets. For
him even the moon over the sea was like some old
hag out of a Villon ballade:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Flaunting, tawdry and grim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From cloud to cloud along her beat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leering her battered and inveterate leer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She signals where he prowls in the dark alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her horrible old man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mumbling old oaths and warming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His villainous old bones with villainous talk.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Similarly, the cat breaking in upon the exquisite
dawn that wakes the “little twitter-and-cheep”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
of the birds in a London Park becomes a
picturesque and obscene figure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A rakehell cat—how furtive and acold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A spent witch homing from some infamous dance—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obscene, quick-trotting, see her tip and fade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or, again, take the description of the East
Wind in <i>London Voluntaries</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of the poisonous East,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over a continent of blight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a maleficent influence released</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the most squalid cellarage of hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Wind-fiend, the abominable—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Hangman Wind that tortures temper and light—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes slouching, sullen and obscene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hard on the skirts of the embittered night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in a cloud unclean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of excremental humours, roused to strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the operation of some ruinous change,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherever his evil mandate run and range,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into a dire intensity of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A craftsman at his bench, he settles down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the grim job of throttling London Town.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is, of its kind, remarkable writing. It
may not reflect a poetic view of life, but it reflects
a romantic and humorous view. Henley’s
humour is seldom good humour: it is, rather, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
sort of boisterous invective. His phrases delight
us like the oaths of some old sea-captain if we
put ourselves in the mood of delight. And how
extravagantly he flings them down, like a pocketful
of money on the counter of a bar! He may
only be a pauper, behaving like a rich man, but
we, who are his guests for an hour, submit to the
illusion and become happy echoes of his wild
talk.</p>

<p>For he has the gift of language. It is not the
loud-sounding sea but loud-sounding words that
are his passion. Compared to Henley, even
Tennyson was modest in his use of large Latin
negatives. His eloquence is sonorous with the
music of “immemorial,” “intolerable,” “immitigable,”
“inexorable,” “unimaginable,” and the
kindred train of words. He is equally in love
with “wonderful,” “magnificent,” “miraculous,”
“immortal,” and all the flock of adjectival
enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here in this radiant and immortal street,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">he cries, as he stands on a spring day in
Piccadilly. He did not use sounding adjectives
without meaning, however. His adjectives express
effectively that lust of life that distinguishes
him from other writers. For it is lust of life, in
contradistinction to love, that is the note of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Henley’s work. He himself lets us into this
secret in the poem that begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love, which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, when he writes of Piccadilly in spring,
he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Look how the liberal and transfiguring air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Washes this inn of memorable meetings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This centre of ravishments and gracious greetings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, through its jocund loveliness of length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A tidal-race of lust from shore to shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A brimming reach of beauty met with strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It shines and sounds like some miraculous dream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some vision multitudinous and agleam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of happiness as it shall be evermore!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The spectacle of life produced in Henley an
almost exclusively physical excitement. He did
not wish to see things transfigured by the light
that never was on sea or land. He preferred the
light on the wheels of a hansom cab or, at best,
the light that falls on the Thames as it flows
through London. His attitude to life, in other
words, was sensual. He could escape out of
circumstances into the sensual enchantments of
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, but there was no escape for
him, as there is for the great poets, into the
general universe of the imagination. This physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
obsession may be put down in a measure to
his long years of ill-health and struggle. But
even a healthy and prosperous Henley, I fancy,
would have been restless, dissatisfied, embittered.
For him most seas were Dead Seas, and most
shores were desolate. The sensualist’s “Dust and
Ashes!” breaks in, not always mournfully, but at
times angrily, upon the high noon of his raptures.
He longs for death as few poets have longed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of art and drink I have had my fill,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">he declares, and the conclusion of the whole
matter is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the end I know is the best of all.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To his mother, to his sister, to Stevenson he
writes this recurrent message—the glad tidings
of death to come. Man’s life is for him but a
child’s wanderings among the shows of a fair:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Till at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tired of experience he turns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the friendly and comforting breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the old nurse, Death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in most of his poems on this theme it
seems to be the peace of the grave he desires, not
an immortality of new experiences. There is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
moving poem, however, dedicating the “windlestraws”
of his verse to his wife in which a reference
to their dead child suggests that he, too, may
have felt the hunger for immortality:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor windlestraws</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the great, sullen, roaring pool of Time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Chance and Change, I know!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But they are yours, as I am, till we attain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That end for which we make, we two that are one:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little exquisite Ghost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Between us, smiling with the serenest eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seen in this world, and calling, calling still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that clear voice whose infinite subtleties</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sweetness, thrilling back across the grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Break the poor heart to hear:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">“<i>Come, Dadsie, come?</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent10"><i>Mama, how long—how long?</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Sufferer and sensualist, Henley found in the
affections some relief from his savage unrest. It
was affection that painted that masterly sonnet-portrait
of Stevenson in <i>Apparition</i>, and there is
affection, too, in that song in praise of England,
<i>Pro Rege Nostro</i>, though much of his praise of
England, like his praise of life, is but poetry of
lust. Lust in action, unfortunately, has a way
of being absurd, and Henley is often absurd in
his lustful—by which one does not mean lascivious—poems.
His <i>Song of the Sword</i> and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
<i>Song of Speed</i> are both a little absurd in their
sheer lustfulness. Here we have a mere extravagance
of physical exultation, with a great deal of
talk about “the Lord,” who is—to the ruin of the
verse—a figure of rhetoric and phrase of excitement,
and not at all the Holy Spirit of the
religious.</p>

<p>Henley, indeed, was for the most part not a
religious man but an egoist. He saw his own
shadow everywhere on the universe, like the
shadow of a crippled but undefeated lion. He
saw himself sometimes with pity, oftener with
pride. One day he found his image in an “old,
black rotter of a boat” that lay stranded at
Shoreham:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With a horrid list, a frightening lapse from the line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That makes me think of legs and a broken spine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But he preferred to think, as in the most famous
of his poems, of his “unconquerable soul,” and to
enjoy the raree-show of life heroically under the
promise of death. To call this attitude vainglorious
is not to belittle it. Henley was a
master in his own school of literature, and his
works live after him. His commixture of rude
and civil phrase may be a dangerous model for
other writers, but with what skill he achieves the
right emphasis and witty magniloquence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
effect! He did not guess (or guess at) the
secrets of life, but he watched the pageant with a
greedy eye, sketched one or two figures that
amused or attracted him, and cheered till his pen
ought to have been hoarse. He also cursed, and,
part of the time, he played with rhymes, as if in
an interchange of railleries. But, in all circumstances,
he was a valiant figure—valiant not only
in words but in the service of words. We need
not count him among the sages, but literature
has also room for the sightseers, and Henley will
have a place among them for many years to come.</p>

<span class="subhead">LORD ROSEBERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Lord Rosebery’s oratory is the port at a banquet.
It is a little somnolent in its charm. Mr. Birrell
has a better cellar of the livelier French wines.
But the Rosebery port is a wine without which no
memorial dinner can come to a perfect end. It
is essentially the wine of memory. It is used to
moisten monumental effigies as champagne is
used to christen ships. As you read his two
volumes of <i>Miscellanies</i>, you get the impression
that, wherever there is an effigy to be unveiled,
you will find Lord Rosebery present with his
noble aspersion of words. I do not know whether
Lord Rosebery himself chooses what effigies he
will talk about or whether he has them chosen
for him. It is difficult to imagine a statue on
which he would not talk admirably. He is the
greatest living showman of statues. Even when
there is no statue to be unveiled, but only a
centenary to be commemorated, he usually sees
the great man in the posture of a statue—a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
larger than life, and with the sins and scandals
discreetly slurred over. Hence it would be in
vain to look in his commemoration addresses for
great character studies or critical interpretations
of genius. They are compliments, not criticisms.
They are spoken on behalf of all present. Lord
Rosebery’s art is the art of the funeral speech
blended with the art of the speech at a distribution
of prizes. Of this difficult though minor art
he is an accomplished practitioner.</p>

<p>Hence it would be ridiculous to judge his
addresses on Burns by the same standards by
which we judge the studies of Carlyle and
Stevenson and Henley on the same subject.
Lord Rosebery’s speeches belong to the literature
of formalities, and it is their chief virtue that they
express the common view with brightness of
emphasis, humour of anecdote, and at times with
a charming sentimental music of speech. They
say what everyone present would regard as the
right thing to say, and they say it very much
better than anybody else on the platform could
say it. He is a spokesman, not a discoverer. His
freshness is that of a man who furnishes what is
already known rather than of one who adds to the
stock of knowledge. That he has also the gifts
of the writer who can add to the stock of knowledge
is shown by his humorous, fascinating and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
amiable portrait of Lord Randolph Churchill.
Here he speaks for himself, not for the meeting.
Lord Randolph is as real to him as a character
in fiction, with his spell, his impudence and his
disaster. As we read this story we feel that, if
he cared, Lord Rosebery might write a book of
reminiscences, telling with detached frankness the
whole truth about himself and his great associates,
which would have an immortal place in
English biographical literature. For the present,
however, we must be content that there should be
someone who can speak the general mind on
Burns and Burke, on Oliver Cromwell and Dr.
Johnson, with a hint of majesty and a lulling
charm.</p>

<p>Certainly, he reveals no secrets that are not
open secrets about his heroes. He is continually
asking “What is his secret?” and the answer is
usually a little disappointing, a little exiguous in
surprise, when it comes. Thus he tells us that
the secret of Burns “lies in two words—inspiration
and sympathy.” That is true, but it leaves
Burns smooth as a statue. Burns appeals to
us surely, not only through his inspiration and
sympathy, but as the spirit of man fluttering
rebelliously, songfully, satirically, against the
bars of orthodoxy. Scotsmen revere him as the
champion of human nature against the Levites.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
His errors, no doubt, were as gross as those of
the Levites, but human nature turns affectionately
to those who protest on its behalf
against tyranny, and Burns with all his sins, was
a liberator. When he comes to Burke, Lord
Rosebery again asks, “What is his secret?” “The
secret of Burke’s character,” he says, “is this, in
my judgment—that he loved reform and hated
revolution.” This, again, leaves Burke with the
eyes of a statue. We shall understand the secret
of Burke much better if we see him as a man
who had far more passionate convictions about
the duties than about the rights of human beings.
He believed in good government and in good
citizenship, but he was never even touched by the
Utopian dream of the perfectibility of man.
Lord Rosebery, indeed, brings the figures of the
dead to life, not in his interpretation of their
secrets, but usually in some anecdote that reminds
us of their profound humanity.</p>

<p>His happiest speeches, as a result, are about
great men whose private lives have already been
laid bare to all the world. When he has to speak
on Thackeray, whose life still remains half a
secret, he devotes more space to literary criticism,
and Thackeray remains for the most part an
effigy hung with wreaths of compliments. It is
the fashion nowadays to speak ill of Thackeray,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
and Lord Rosebery’s extravagances on the other
side would tempt even a moderate man into disparagement.
He refers to Thackeray as “the
giant whom we discuss to-day.” There could
not be a more inappropriate word for Thackeray
than “giant.” One might almost as well call
Jane Austen a “giantess.” Charlotte Brontë,
as a young author coming under Thackeray’s
spell, might legitimately feel that she was in the
presence of a Titan. But a man may be a Titan
to his contemporaries and yet be no Titan in the
long line of great authors. Thackeray, I am convinced,
is greatly underestimated to-day, but he
will come back into his own only if we are prepared
to welcome him on a level considerably
below that of the Titans—below Dickens and
Tolstoy, below even Sterne. Not that Lord
Rosebery finds nothing to censure in Thackeray.
Though he remarks that <i>Vanity Fair</i> “appears
to many of us the most full and various novel in
the English language,” he has no praise for “the
limp Amelia and the shadowy Dobbin.” At the
same time, he turns aside his censures with a compliment.
“The blemishes of <i>Vanity Fair</i> exalt
the book,” he declares; “for what must be the
merits of a work which absolutely eclipse such
defects?” It is one of the perils of oratory that
it leads men to utter sentences of this kind. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
mean little or nothing, but they have the ring of
amiability. On the other hand, Lord Rosebery
makes no concession to amiability in his criticism
of <i>Esmond</i>. “The plot to me,” he says, “is
simply repulsive. The transformation of Lady
Castlewood from a mother to a wife is unnatural
and distasteful to the highest degree. Thackeray
himself declared that he could not help it. This,
I think, only means that he saw no other than
this desperate means of extricating the story. I
cannot help it, too. One likes what one likes, and
one dislikes what one dislikes.” An occasional
reservation of this kind helps to give flavour to
Lord Rosebery’s compliments. It gives them
the air of being the utterances, not of a professional
panegyrist, but of a detached and impartial
mind. Thus he begins his eulogy of Dr.
Johnson with a confession that Johnson’s own
writings are dead for him apart from “two poems
and some pleasing biographies.” “Speaking as
an individual and illiterate Briton”—so he makes
his confession. It is as though the tide withdrew
in order to come in with all the more surprising
volume.</p>

<p>One thing that must strike many readers with
astonishment while reading these speeches and
studies is that an orator so famous for his delicate
wit should reveal so little delight in the wit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
authors. His enthusiasm is largely moral enthusiasm.
We think of Lord Rosebery as a
<i>dilettante</i>, and yet the <i>dilettanti</i> of literature and
public life make only a feeble appeal to him. He
is interested in few but men of strong character
and men of action. His heroes are such men as
Cromwell and Mr. Gladstone. Is it that he is
an ethical <i>dilettante</i>, or is it that he is seeking in
these vehement natures a strength of which he
feels the lack in himself? Certainly, as we read
him, he casts the shadow of a man who has almost
all the elements of greatness except this strength.
He has been Prime Minister, he has won the
Derby, he has achievements behind him sufficient
(one would imagine) to fill three lives with
success, and yet somehow we picture him as a
brilliant failure as we picture the young man who
had great possessions. These very <i>Miscellanies</i>
bear the stamp of failure. They are the praises
of famous men spoken from a balcony in the
Castle of Indolence. They are graceful and
delightful. But they are haunted by a curious
pathos, for the eyes of the speaker gaze wistfully
from where he stands towards the path that leads
to the Hill Difficulty and the pilgrims who advance
along it under heavy burdens to their perils
and rewards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II_VIII"><span id="toclink_237"></span>VIII<br>

<span class="subhead">MR. VACHEL LINDSAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Lindsay objects to being called a “jazz
poet”; and, if the name implied that he did
nothing in verse but make a loud, facetious, and
hysterical noise, his objection would be reasonable.
It is possible to call him a “jazz poet,” however,
for the purpose not of belittling him, but of
defining one of his leading qualities. He is
essentially the poet of a worked-up audience. He
relies on the company for the success of his
effects, like a Negro evangelist. The poet, as a
rule, is a solitary in his inspiration. He is more
likely to address a star than a crowded room.
Mr. Lindsay is too sociable to write like that.
He invites his readers to a party, and the world
for him is a round game. To read “The Skylark”
or the “Ode to a Nightingale” in the hunt-the-slipper
mood in which one enjoys “The Daniel
Jazz” would be disastrous. Shelley and Keats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
give us the ecstasy of a communion, not the excitement
of a party. The noise of the world, the
glare, and the jostling crowds fade as we read.
The audience of Shelley or Keats is as still as the
audience in a cathedral. Mr. Lindsay, on the
other hand, calls for a chorus, like a singer at
a smoking-concert. That is the spirit in which he
has written his best work. He is part entertainer
and part evangelist, but in either capacity he
seems to demand not an appreciative hush, but an
appreciative noise.</p>

<p>It is clear that he is unusually susceptible to
crowd excitement. His two best poems, “Bryan,
Bryan” and “The Congo,” are born of it.
“Bryan, Bryan” is an amazing attempt to recapture
and communicate a boy’s emotions as he
mingled in the scrimmage of the Presidential
election of 1896. Mr. Lindsay becomes all but
inarticulate as he recalls the thrill and tumult of
the marching West when Bryan called on it to
advance against the Plutocrats. He seems to be
shouting like a student when students hire a bus
and go forth in masks and fancy dress to make
a noise in the streets. Luckily, he makes an
original noise. He knows that his excitement is
more than he can express in intelligible speech,
and so he wisely and humorously calls in the aid
of nonsense, which he uses with such skill and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
vehemence that everybody is forced to turn round
and stare at him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, the long-horns from Texas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The jay hawks from Kansas,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The varmint, chipmunk, bugaboo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The horned toad, prairie-dog, and ballyhoo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From all the new-born states arow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bidding the eagles of the West fly on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bidding the eagles of the West fly on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fawn, prodactyl, and thing-a-ma-jig,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The whangdoodle, batfowl and pig,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The coyote, wild-cat, and grizzly in a glow,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ah—sharp was their song.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against the ways of Tubal Cain, too cunning for the young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The long-horn calf, the buffalo, and wampus gave tongue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In such a passage as this Mr. Lindsay pours
decorative nonsense out of a horn of plenty. But
his aim is not to talk nonsense: it is to use nonsense
as the language of reality. As paragraph
follows paragraph, we see with what sureness he
is piling colour on colour and crash on crash in
order that we may respond almost physically to
the sensations of those magnificent and tumultuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
days. He has discovered a new sort of
rhetoric which enables him to hurry us through
mood after mood of comic, pugnacious and sentimental
excitement. Addressed to a religious
meeting, rhetoric of this kind would be interrupted
by cries of “Glory, Hallelujah!” and
“Praise de Lord!” Unless you are rhetoric-proof,
you cannot escape its spell. Isolated from
its context, the passage I have quoted may be
subjected to cold criticism. It is only when it
keeps its place in the living body of the poem and
becomes part of the general attack on our nerves
that it is irresistibly effective.</p>

<p>In “The Congo,” it is the excitement of
Negroes—in their dances and their religion—that
Mr. Lindsay has set to words. As he watches
their revels, the picture suggests a companion-picture
of Negroes orgiastic in Africa, in the true
Kingdom of Mumbo-Jumbo—a Negro’s fairy-tale
of a magic land:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Just then from the doorway, as fat as shotes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came the cake-walk princes in their long red coats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Canes with a brilliant lacquer shine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tall silk hats that were red as wine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they pranced with their butterfly partners there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coal-black maidens with pearls in their hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knee-skirts trimmed with the jessamine sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bells on their ankles and little black feet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>
<p class="in0">But it is the grotesque comedy of the American
Negro, not the fantasia on Africa, that makes
“The Congo” so entertaining a poem. The description
of the “fat black bucks in a wine-barrel
room” has often been quoted. There is the same
feeling of “racket” in the picture of a religious
camp meeting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A good old negro in the slums of the town</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Preached at a sister for her velvet gown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howled at a brother for his low-down ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His prowling, guzzling, sneak-thief days;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beat on the Bible till he wore it out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starting the jubilee revival shout.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And some had visions as they stood on chairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sang of Jacob, and the golden stairs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they all repented, a thousand strong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From their stupor and savagery and sin and wrong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And slammed on their hymn books till they shook the room</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With “glory, glory, glory,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And “Boom, boom, <i>Boom</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whatever qualities Mr. Lindsay lacks, he has
humour, colour and gusto. When he writes in
the tradition of the serious poets, as in “Abraham
Lincoln Walks at Midnight” and “Epilogue,” he
is negligible: he is only one of a thousand capable
verse-writers. He is dependent on his own idiom
to a greater extent even than was Robert Burns.
Not that his work in rag-time English is comparable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
in other respects to Burns’s in Scots.
Burns’s themes were, apart from his comic verse,
the traditional themes of the poets—the aristocrats
of the spirit. Mr. Lindsay is a humorist
and sentimentalist who is essentially a democrat
of the spirit—one of the crowd.</p>

<p>And, just as he is the humorist of the crowd, so
is he the humorist of things immense and exaggerated.
His imagination is the playground
of whales and elephants and sea-serpents. He is
happy amid the clangour and confusion of a
railway-junction. He rejoices in the exuberant
and titanic life of California, where:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thunder-clouds of grapes grow on the mountains.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and he boasts that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There are ten gold suns in California,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all other lands have one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the Golden Gate must have due light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And persimmons be well done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the hot whales slosh and cool in the wash</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the fume of the hollow sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rally and roam in the loblolly foam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And whoop that their souls are free.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Lindsay himself can whoop like a whale.
He is a poet in search of superlatives beyond the
superlatives. He cannot find them, but he at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
least articulates new sounds. As one reads him,
one is reminded at times of a child in a railway-train
singing and shouting against the noise of
the engine and the wheels. The world affects
Mr. Lindsay as the railway-train affects some
children. He is intoxicated by the rhythm of the
machinery. As a result, though he is often an
ethical poet, he is seldom a spiritual poet. That
helps to explain why his verse does not achieve
any but a sentimental effect in his andante movements.
As his voice falls, his inspiration falls.
In “The Santa Fé Trail” he breaks in on the
frenzy of a thousand motors with the still, small
voice of the bird called the Rachel Jane. He undoubtedly
moves us by the way in which he does
this; but he moves us much as a sentimental
singer at a ballad concert can do. It is not for
passages of this kind that one reads him. His
words at their best do not minister at the altar:
they dance to the music of the syncopated
orchestra. That is Mr. Lindsay’s peculiar gift.
It would hardly be using too strong a word to
say that it is his genius.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II_IX"><span id="toclink_244"></span>IX<br>

<span class="subhead">MR. PUNCH TAKES THE WRONG TURNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">There are those who gibe at <i>Punch</i>. There are
also those who gibe at those who gibe at <i>Punch</i>.
The match is a fairly even one. <i>Punch</i> is undoubtedly
not as good as it used to be, but it is
not quite so certain that it is not as clever as it
used to be. Very few people realise that <i>Punch</i>
was once a good paper—that it was a good paper,
I mean in the Charles-Kingsley sense of the
adjective. It began in 1841, as Mr. C.&nbsp;L. Graves
prettily says, by “being violently and vituperatively
on the side of the angels.” If <i>Punch</i> had
kept pace with the times it would, in these days,
at the age of eighty, be suspected of Socialism.
Its championship of the poor against those who
prospered on the poverty of the poor was as
vehement as a Labour speech at a street-corner.
One of the features of the early <i>Punch</i> was a
“Pauper’s Corner,” in which “the cry of the
people found frequent and touching utterance.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
It was in the Christmas number of <i>Punch</i> in
1843 that Hood’s “Song of the Shirt” was first
published. Mark Lemon, the editor, insisted on
publishing it, though all his colleagues were opposed
to him on the point. In the following
years we find the same indignant sense of realities
expressing itself in Leech’s cartoon, “The
Home of the Rick Burner,” which emphasised
the fact that the cause of an outburst of incendiarism
in Suffolk was the greed of the
farmers who underpaid their labourers. <i>Punch</i>
also took up the cause of the sweated labourers in
verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll sing you a fine old song, improved by a modern pate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of a fine Old English Gentleman, who owns a large estate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But pays the labourers on it a very shabby rate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some seven shillings each a week for early work and late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gives this fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Nor did <i>Punch</i> shrink from looking a good deal
higher than the fine Old English Gentleman for
his victims. He had a special, almost a Lloyd
Georgian, taste for baiting dukes. He attacked
the Duke of Norfolk with admirable irony for
suggesting to the poor that they should eke out
their miserable fare by using curry powder. He
made butts in turn of the Duke of Marlborough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the Duke of Buckingham, the Duke of Sutherland,
the Duke of Richmond and the Duke of
Atholl. He did not spare even the Duke of
Wellington. “The old Duke,” he declared,
“should no longer block up the great thoroughfare
of civilisation—he should be quietly and
respectfully eliminated.” It was in the same
mood that the Marquis of Londonderry was
denounced both as a tyrannical coal-owner and
an enemy of the Queen’s English—“the most
noble, but not the most grammatical Marquis.”
<i>Punch’s</i> view of the House of Lords is expressed
with considerable directness in his scheme for
reforming the Chamber, which begins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is an indisputable truth that there can be no such
thing as a born legislator. As unquestionable is the
fact that there may be a born ass.</p>

<p>But your born ass may be born to your legislator’s
office, and command a seat in the house of legislators
by inheritance, as in not a few examples, wherein the
coronet hides not the donkey’s ears.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">This is not particularly brilliant. It is interesting
not so much in itself as because it is the sort
of thing with which <i>Punch</i> used regularly to
regale its readers. <i>Punch</i> in those days was a
paper with a purpose. Its humour, like
Dickens’s was to a certain extent a missionary
humour. <i>Punch</i> saw himself as the rescuer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
underdog, and, if he could not achieve his object
comically, he was prepared to do it angrily. He
did not hesitate to fling his cap and bells rudely
in the face of royalty itself. He might be accused
of vulgarity, but not of being, as he has since
become, the more or less complacent advocate of
Toby, the top-dog.</p>

<p>Mr. Graves seems to think that the change in
the spirit of <i>Punch</i> is due to the mellowness that
comes with increasing years. But the real reason,
I fancy, is that, while <i>Punch</i> began under an
editor whose sympathies were with the bottom-dog,
the sympathies of later editors have been
much more respectable. It is not that <i>Punch</i> has
lost the fire of youth, but that it has lost the
generosity of the Victorian man of letters. It
was, it may be admitted, easier to be generous in
those days. A Victorian could make himself the
champion of the ill-used poor without any feeling
that he was assisting in bringing about a new
order in society. A middle-class Georgian who
attaches himself to the same cause cannot do so
without realising that it is not a question of
patching an old suit of clothes, but of making a
new and a better one. The Victorian committed
himself to charity. The Georgian has to commit
himself to the cold-blooded charity of equality.
<i>Punch</i>, indeed, seems to have begun to take alarm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
as soon as the Chartist movement made it appear
likely that the workers were going to demand,
not sympathetic treatment, but something like
self-determination. By 1873, according to Mr.
Graves, “references to the champagne-habit
among the miners abound.” In a cartoon, “From
the Coal Districts,” we are shown a lady in a
fruiterer’s saying, “I’m afraid I must give up
the pineapple, Mr. Green! Eight shillings is
really too much!” She is interrupted by a
“successful collier” who bids the fruiterer, “Just
put ’em up for <i>me</i>, then, Master. ’Ere’s ’arf a
sovereign; and look ’ere—yer may keep the
change if yer’ll <i>only tell us ’ow to cook ’un</i>.”
<i>Punch</i>, as we know it to-day, had been born.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace the change in the
temper of <i>Punch</i>, not only in domestic, but in
foreign, affairs. <i>Punch</i> appears to have given up
his pacifism—or, as Mr. Graves calls it with reforming
zeal, his “pacificism”—as a result of his
generous sympathy with insurgent Italians and
Hungarians. That was the thin end of the
wedge. Having once drawn the sword, <i>Punch</i>
found it even more enjoyable than drawing
cartoons. He drew it fiercely against the
Russians in the Crimean War. He drew it
fiercely against the Indians in the Indian Mutiny.
He drew it on behalf of General Eyre after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
negro outbreak in Jamaica. He drew it against
Lincoln in the American Civil War. Mr. Graves
ought, for historical reasons, to have reprinted
<i>Punch’s</i> parody on one of Lincoln’s speeches.
He is content, however, to describe it as “a truly
lamentable performance, in which the President
claims dictatorial powers, calls for whipcord to
whip the rebels, abuses the ‘rotten old world,’
talks with the utmost cynicism of the blacks, and
in general behaves like a vulgar buffoon.” Mr.
Graves, with an impartiality which cannot be
too highly praised, reminds the <i>Punch</i> of those
days that “the magnanimous Lincoln would
never allow” the Southerners to be called rebels
in his presence—a significant reminder when we
recall how Mr. Lloyd George drew on the
Lincoln parallel in defending his treatment of
the Irish. But, for the ironist, the most amusing
of all <i>Punch’s</i> blunders in regard to foreign
policy is the welcome he offered to the birth of
the German Navy in an article called “Bravo,
Bismarck!” “Britannia through her <i>Punch</i>,” he
wrote, “rejoices to weave among her naval azures
a new shade—Prussian blue.” It is only fair to
say that <i>Punch</i> was not consistent in his attitude
to Germany. But he has shown a curious capacity
for backing the wrong horse—the horse
that seemed to “get away” at the start, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
was ultimately disqualified by the stern judge,
history. He gave up championing lost causes
and took to championing causes that would be
lost a generation later.</p>

<p>In the result, Mr. Graves, though a wit of
distinction, has produced in <i>Mr. Punch’s History
of Modern England</i> a book that is pathetic rather
than amusing. It is a cemetery of dead jokes—the
offspring of a little gentleman with a long
nose who was cross more often than he was funny.
<i>Punch</i>, indeed, has been for the most part a grinner
rather than a wit. It has had, and still has,
brilliant writers on its staff. But its temper is
not the temper of its most brilliant contributors.
Its attitude is that of the prosperous clubman
who dislikes the advance both of the new rich and
of the old poor. It has undoubtedly made itself
the most successful comic paper in the world, but
one sometimes wonders whether it has done so as
a result of allying itself with comedy or of allying
itself with success. Yet the fact remains that
other men have started rivals to <i>Punch</i>, and that
they have not only been not so successful as
<i>Punch</i> but not so comic. <i>Punch</i> always baits the
hook of its odious politics with a reasonable
amount of comedy about things in general, and in
the comedy of things in general, even if we think
it might be done still better, it has at least always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
been ahead of its rivals. There have been men
who have dreamed of a <i>Punch</i> that would bring
the spirit of comedy to bear on all sides impartially.
There are others who have dreamed of
bringing the spirit of comedy to bear on the right
side. One would not, perhaps, mind what side
<i>Punch</i> was on if only it were a little more generous—if
only it purveyed the human comedy as a
comedy, and not, as in the case of working men,
Irishmen, and non-Allied foreigners, as a sinister
crook melodrama.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. H.&nbsp;M. TOMLINSON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Tomlinson is a born traveller. There are
two sorts of travellers—those who do what they
are told and those who do what they please. Mr.
Tomlinson has never moved about the world in
obedience to a guide-book. He would find it
almost as difficult to read a guide-book as to write
one. He never echoes other men’s curiosity. He
travels for the purpose neither of information nor
conversation. He has no motive but whim. His
imagination goes roaming; and, his imagination
and his temper being such as they are, he is out on
his travels even if he gets no farther than Limehouse
or the Devonshire coast. He has, indeed,
wandered a good deal farther than Limehouse
and Devonshire, as readers of <i>The Sea and the
Jungle</i> know. Even in his more English volumes
of sketches, essays, confessions, short stories—how
is one to describe them?—he takes us with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
him to the north coast of Africa, to New York,
and to France in war time. But the English
sketches—the description of the crowd at a pit-mouth
after an explosion in a coal mine, the account
of a derelict railway station and a grocer’s
boy in spectacles—almost equally give us the feeling
that we are reading the narrative of one who
has seen nothing except with the fortunate eyes of
a stranger. It is all a matter of eyes. To see is
to discover, and all Mr. Tomlinson’s books are,
in this sense, books of discoveries.</p>

<p>As a recorder of the things he has seen he has
the three great gifts of imagery, style and
humour. He sees the jelly-fish hanging in the
transparent deeps “like sunken moons.” A boat
sailing on a windy day goes skimming over the
inflowing ridges of the waves “with exhilarating
undulations, light as a sandpiper.” A queer Lascar
on a creeping errand in an East-end street
“looked as uncertain as a candle-flame in a
draught.” How well again Mr. Tomlinson conveys
to us in a sentence or two the vision of
Northern Africa on a wet day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As for Bougie, these African villages are built but
for sunlight. They change to miserable and filthy
ruins in the rain, their white walls blotched and scabrous,
and their paths mud tracks between the styes.
Their lissome and statuesque inhabitants become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
softened and bent, and pad dejectedly through the
muck as though they were ashamed to live, but had
to go on with it. The palms which look so well in
sunny pictures are besoms up-ended in a drizzle.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Tomlinson has in that last sentence captured
the ultimate secret of a wet day in an African
village. Even those of us who have never seen
Africa save on the map, know that often there is
nothing more to be said. Mr. Tomlinson, however,
is something of a specialist in bad weather,
as, perhaps, any man who loves the sea as he
does must be. The weather fills the world for the
seaman with gods and demons. The weather is
at once the day’s adventure and the day’s pageant.
Mr. Conrad has written one of the greatest
stories in the world simply about the weather and
the soul of man. He may be said to be the first
novelist writing in English to have kept his
weather-eye open. Mr. Tomlinson shares Mr.
Conrad’s sensitive care for these things. His
description of a storm of rain bursting on the
African hills makes you see the things as you
read. In its setting, even an unadorned and
simple sentence <span class="locked">like——</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As Yeo luffed, the squall fell on us bodily with a
great weight of wind and white rain, pressing us into
the sea,</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p class="in0">compels our presence among blowing winds and
dangerous waters.</p>

<p>But, weather-beaten as Mr. Tomlinson’s pages
are, there is more in them than the weather.
There is an essayish quality in his books, personal,
confessional, go-as-you-please. The majority of
essays have egotism without personality. Mr.
Tomlinson’s sketches have personality without
egotism. He is economical of discussion of his
own tastes. When he does discuss them you
know that here is no make-believe of confession.
Take, for instance, the comment on place-names
with which he prefaces his account of his disappointment
with Tripoli:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You probably know there are place-names, which,
when whispered privately, have the unreasonable power
of translating the spirit east of the sun and west of
the moon. They cannot be seen in print without a
thrill. The names in the atlas which do that for me
are a motley lot, and you, who see no magic in them,
but have your own lunacy in another phase, would
laugh at mine. Celebes, Acapulco, Para, Port Royal,
Cartagena, the Marquesas, Panama, the Mackenzie
River, Tripoli of Barbary—they are some of mine.
Rome should be there, I know, and Athens, and
Byzantium. But they are not, and that is all I can
say about it.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">That is the farthest Mr. Tomlinson ever gets on
the way towards arrogance. He ignores Rome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
and Athens. They are not among the ports of
call of his imagination. He prefers the world
that sailors tell about to the world that scholars
talk about. He will not write about—he will
scarcely even interest himself in—any world but
that which he has known in the intimacy of his
imaginative or physical experience. Places that
he has seen and thought of, ships, children, stars,
books, animals, soldiers, workers—of all these
things he will tell you with a tender realism,
lucid and human because they are part of his
life. But the tradition that is not his own he
throws aside as a burden. He will carry no
pack save of the things that have touched his
heart and his imagination.</p>

<p>I wish all his sketches had been as long as “The
African Coast.” It is so good that it makes one
want to send him travelling from star to star of
all those names that mean more to him than
Byzantium. One desires even to keep him a
prisoner for a longer period among the lights of
New York. He should have written about the
blazing city at length, as he has written about the
ferries. His description of the lighted ferries and
the woman passenger who had forgotten Jimmy’s
boots, remains in the memory. Always in his
sketches we find some such significant “thing
seen.” On the voyage home from New York on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
floating hotel it is the passing of a derelict sailing
ship, “mastless and awash,” that suddenly recreates
for him the reality of the ocean. After
describing the assaults of the seas on the doomed
hulk, he goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was something ironic in the indifference of
her defenceless body to these unending attacks. It
mocked this white and raging post-mortem brutality,
and gave her a dignity that was cold and superior to
all the eternal powers could now do. She pitched
helplessly head first into a hollow, and a door flew
open under the break of her poop; it surprised and
shocked us, for the dead might have signed to us then.
She went astern of us fast, and a great comber ran at
her, as if it had just spied her, and thought she was
escaping. There was a high white flash, and a concussion
we heard. She had gone. But she appeared
again far away, forlorn on a summit in desolation,
black against the sunset. The stump of her bowsprit,
the accusatory finger of the dead, pointed at the sky.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">We find in “The Ruins” (which is a sketch of a
town in France just evacuated by the Germans)
an equally imaginative use made of a key incident.
First, we have the description of the
ruined town itself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>House-fronts had collapsed in rubble across the
road. There is a smell of opened vaults. All the homes
are blind. Their eyes have been put out. Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
the buildings are without roofs, and their walls have
come down to raw serrations. Slates and tiles have
avalanched into the street, or the roof itself is entire,
but has dropped sideways over the ruin below as a
drunken cap over the dissolute.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">And so on till we come to the discovery of a corn-chandler’s
ledger lying in the mud of the roadway.
Only an artist could have made a
tradesman’s ledger a symbol of hope and resurrection
on a shattered planet as Mr. Tomlinson
has done. He picks out from the disordered
procession of things treasures that most of us
would pass with hardly a glance. His clues to the
meaning of the world are all of his own finding.
It is this that gives his work the savour and freshness
of literature.</p>

<p>As for clues to Mr. Tomlinson’s own mind and
temper, do we not discover plenty of them in his
confessions about books? He is a man who likes
to read <i>The Voyage to the Houyhnhnms</i> in bed.
Heine and Samuel Butler and Anatole France
are among his favourite authors. There is
nothing in his work to suggest that he has taken
any of them for his models. But there is a vein
of rebellious irony in his writing that enables one
to realise why his imagination finds in Swift
good company. He, too, has felt his heart
lacerated, especially in these late days of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
world’s corruption. His writing would be bitter,
one feels, were it not for the strength of his
affections. Humanity and irony contend in his
work, and humanity is fortunately the winner.
In the result, the world in his books is not permanently
a mud-ball, but a star shining in space.
Perhaps it is in gratitude for this that we find it
possible at last even to forgive him his contemptuous
references to Coleridge’s <i>Table-talk</i>—that
cache of jewels buried in metaphysical
cotton-wool.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ALLEGED HOPELESSNESS OF TCHEHOV</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">A Russian critic has said that Tchehov had nothing
to give his fellows but a philosophy of
hopelessness. He committed the crime of
destroying men’s faith in God, morals, progress,
and art. This is an accusation that takes one’s
breath away. If ever there was a writer who
had a genius for consolation—a genius for
stretching out a hand to his floundering fellow-mortals—it
was Tchehov. He was as active in
service as a professional philanthropist. His
faith in the decency of men was as inextinguishable
as his doubt. His tenderness was a passion.
He was open-hearted to all comers. He never
shut his door either on a poor man needing
medicine, or on a young man needing praise. He
was equally generous as author, doctor and reformer.
He who has been represented as a disbeliever
in anything was no disbeliever even in
contemporary men of genius. His attitude to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Tolstoy was not one of idolatry, but it came as
near being idolatrous as is possible for a clever
man. “I am afraid of Tolstoy’s death,” he wrote
in 1900. “If he were to die there would be a big,
empty place in my life.... I have never loved
any man as much as him. I am not a believing
man, but of beliefs I consider his the nearest and
most akin to me.” In his gloomier moods he
thought little enough of the work either of himself
or his younger contemporaries. “We are
stale,” he wrote; “we can only beget gutta-percha
boys.” But this was because he was on his knees
before everything that is greatest in literature.
In a letter to his friend, Suvorin, editor of the
<i>Novoe Vremya</i>, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The writers, who we say are for all time or are simply
good, and who intoxicate us, have one common and
very important characteristic—they are going towards
something and summoning you towards it, too, and
you feel, not with your mind but with your whole
being, that they have some object, just like the ghost
of Hamlet’s father, who did not come and disturb the
imagination for nothing. Some have more immediate
objects—the abolition of serfdom, the liberation of
their country, politics, beauty, or simply vodka, like
Denis Davgdov; others have remote objects—God,
life beyond the grave, the happiness of humanity, and
so on. The best of them are idealists, and paint life
as it is, but, through every life’s being soaked in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
consciousness of an object, you feel, besides life as it
is, the life which ought to be, and that captivates you.</p>
</div>

<p>If this is the confession of an unbeliever, a
philosopher of hopelessness, we may reasonably
ask for a new definition of belief.</p>

<p>Tchehov, indeed, was born with an impulse
towards reverence and faith. Though he denied
that he was either a Liberal or a Conservative, he
excited himself about causes like a schoolboy
revolutionary. He had a religious sense of justice.
He was ardently on Zola’s side during the
Dreyfus excitement. “Let Dreyfus be guilty,”
he declared, “and Zola is still right, since it is the
duty of writers not to accuse, not to persecute,
but to champion even the guilty once they have
been condemned and are enduring imprisonment....
There are plenty of accusers, persecutors,
and gendarmes without them, and in
any case the rôle of Paul suits them better than
that of Saul.” He quarrelled with Suvorin for
attacking Zola. “To abuse Zola when he is on
his trial—that is unworthy of literature.”</p>

<p>We find the same ardent reforming spirit running
through the whole of Tchehov’s life. At one
time he is engrossed in a project for building in
Moscow a “People’s Palace,” with a library,
reading-rooms, a lecture-room, a museum, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
theatre. At another time, he is off to the island of
Saghalin to study with his own eyes the horrors
of the Siberian penal system. “My God,” he
writes in the course of his investigations, “how
rich Russia is in good people! If it were not for
the cold which deprives Siberia of the summer,
and if it were not for the officials who corrupt the
peasants, Siberia would be the richest and happiest
of lands.” In another letter he looks forward
to building a school “in the village where I
am a school-warden.” When a plague of cholera
breaks out, we find Tchehov once more living for
others with the same saintly unselfishness. At
times, no doubt, he cursed the cholera and he
cursed his patients like a human being; but his
cries were the cries of an exhausted body; they
were merely a proof of the zeal that had worn
him out. There is an attractive portrait of
Tchehov at this time in the biographical sketch
that precedes the English translation of his
letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He returned home shattered and exhausted, but
always behaved as though he were doing something
trivial; he cracked little jokes and made everyone
laugh as before, and carried on conversations with his
dachshund Quinine, about her supposed sufferings.</p>
</div>

<p>This may be consistent with the philosophy of
despair. It is certainly very unlike the practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of despair. But that Tchehov’s creed was the
opposite of a creed of despair may be seen in
letter after letter. In one letter he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe in individual people. I see salvation in
individual personalities scattered here and there all
over Russia—educated people or peasants—they have
strength though they are few.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">In another letter he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Modern culture is only the first beginning of work
for a great future, work which will perhaps go on for
tens of thousands of years, in order that man may, if
only in the remote future, come to know the truth of
the real God—that is not, I conjecture, by seeking in
Dostoievsky, but by clear knowledge, as one knows
twice two are four.</p>
</div>

<p>If one thing is obvious, it is that the writer of
these sentences is an enthusiast. Take him, again,
when he is protesting against “trade-marks and
labels” for artists, and announcing his creed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My holy of holies is the human body, health, intelligence,
talent, inspiration, love, and the most absolute
freedom—freedom from violence and lying, whatever
forms they may take. This is the programme I would
follow if I were a great artist.</p>
</div>

<p>In regard to literature, he believed not in the
disheartening sort of realism but in a temperate
idealism, as we learn from an excellent parable:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Ham only noticed that his father was a drunkard, and
completely lost sight of the fact that he was a genius,
that he had built an ark and saved the world. Writers
must not imitate Ham....</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, Tchehov was always alert
to defend the practice of honest realism in literature.
He refused to admit that it is the object
of literature to “unearth the pearl from the
refuse-heap”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A writer is not a confectioner, not a provider of
cosmetics, not an entertainer; he is a man bound,
under contract, by his sense of duty and his conscience;
having put his hand to the plough, he mustn’t turn
back, and however distasteful, he must conquer his
squeamishness and soil his imagination with the dirt
of life. He is just like any ordinary reporter. What
would you say if a newspaper correspondent, out of a
feeling of fastidiousness or from a wish to please his
readers, would describe only honest mayors, high-minded
ladies, and virtuous railway contractors?</p>
</div>

<p>In Tchehov’s view, it is the duty of the artist
to tell the truth about his characters, not to draw
morals from them. “The artist,” he declares,
“must not be the judge of his characters and of
their conversations, but merely an impartial
witness.” The artist must, no doubt, strive after
some such impartiality as this. But the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
artist will never quite attain to it. Shakespeare,
Dickens, and Tchehov himself, all lavished
affection on some of their characters and withheld
it from others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the artist must be tolerant
to a degree that frequently shocks the orthodox
moralist. He approaches individual men, not as
a censor, but as a recorder. Tchehov, writing to
a friend from his country estate, relates, for instance:
“The village priest often comes and
pays me long visits; he is a very good fellow, a
widower, and has some illegitimate children.”
To the stern moralist, a priest who is a very good
fellow with some illegitimate children is an unthinkable
paradox. To the artist it is a paradox
that exists in nature: he accepts it with a smile.
It is not that Tchehov was indifferent to the vices
of the flesh. We find him writing on one occasion
to a great journalist: “Why do they write nothing
about prostitution in your paper? It is the
most fearful evil, you know. Our Sobelev street
is a regular slave-market.”</p>

<p>Tchehov, indeed, like every great artist, was a
man divided. He had the artist’s passion for
describing his fellow-men: he had also the
doctor’s passion for helping them. He was in a
sense pulled in opposite directions by these rival
passions. Luckily, the tug-of-war, instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
weakening, positively strengthened his genius.
The great artist is a reformer transformed.
Shakespeare is sometimes held to have lived aloof
from the reformer’s temporary passions. But
that repeated summons to reconciliation in his
plays is the <i>credo</i> of a man who has plumbed the
great secret of the liberalism of his time and,
equally, of ours. Pity, tenderness, love, or whatever
you choose to call it, is an essential ingredient
of the greatest genius, whether in reform or in
art. It is the absence of pity that is the final condemnation
of most of the literature, painting, and
sculpture of our time. When pity is exhausted,
the best part of genius is exhausted, and there is
little but cleverness left. In Tchehov, more than
in almost any other author of recent years, truth
and tenderness are united. He tells us the truth
even when it is most cruel, but he himself is kind.
He often writes like a doctor going his rounds in
a sick world. But he cares for the sick world.
That is why his stories delight us as the synthetic
golden syrup of more optimistic authors never
does.</p>

<span class="subhead">NIETZSCHE: A NOTE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">“<i>And thus I wander alone like a rhinoceros.</i>”
Nietzsche writes in one of his letters that he had
discovered this “strong closing sentence” in an
English translation of the sacred books of the
Buddhists and had made it a “household word.”
It is at once a grotesque and an apt image of his
isolation in a world of men and women. His
solitude made him perilous: it ultimately exalted
his egoism into madness. There are few more
amazing passages in the annals of literature than
those containing the last letters between the mad
Nietzsche and the mad Strindberg. Nietzsche,
signing himself “Nietzsche Cæsar,” wrote on
New Year’s Eve, 1888:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have appointed a meeting day of monarchs in
Europe. I shall order ... to be shot.</p>

<p>Au revoir! For we shall surely see each other again.</p>

<p>On one condition only. Let us divorce.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p class="in0">Strindberg, writing on the same date and signing
himself “The best, the highest God,” began his
letter to Nietzsche: “I will, I will be raving
mad,” and concluded it:</p>

<div class="blockquot narrow2">

<p>Meanwhile, let us rejoice in our madness. Fare you
well and be true to your</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Strindberg</span></span><br>
(The best, the highest God).
</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Nietzsche’s reply was:</p>

<div class="blockquot narrow2">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Strindberg</span>:</p>

<p>Alas! ... no more! Let us divorce!</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">The Crucified.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Oscar Levy, in his introduction to an
English selection from Nietzsche’s letters, vigorously
objects to the emphasis that has been laid by
some critics on Nietzsche’s madness. It is a
reasonable protest, if the accusation is put forward
in order to damage Nietzsche’s fame as an
artist among philosophers. Dr. Levy, however,
goes so far on the other side that he almost
leaves us with a picture of Nietzsche as a perfectly
normal man with all the normal “slave
virtues.” “A good friend, a devoted son, an
affectionate brother, and a generous enemy”—“not
the slightest trace of any lack of judgment”—“perfectly
healthy and lucid”—such are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
the phrases in which the Nietzsche of these letters
is portrayed. We are told that “even the curious
last letter to Georg Brandes still gives a perfect
sense.” Here is the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot narrow2">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">To the Friend Georg.</span>
</p>

<p>Having been discovered by you no trick was necessary
for the others to find me. The difficulty is now
to get rid of me.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">The Crucified.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>It would, I agree, be ridiculous to dwell on the
madness at the close of Nietzsche’s life, if such
extravagant claims had not been made for him by
his followers. But the madness of Nietzsche is
relevant enough in a criticism of his philosophy,
if we are asked to accept him as one of the inspired
guides to life.</p>

<p>Nietzsche himself was at once terrified and intoxicated
by his sense of his own abnormal
difference from common men. He knew, in part
of his nature, that this aloofness was an evil. He
craved for sympathy so passionately at times that
he cried to one of his friends: “The whole of my
philosophy totters after one hour’s sympathetic
intercourse even with total strangers!” About
the same time—it was in 1880—he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One ceases from loving oneself properly when one
<i>ceases</i> from exercising oneself in love towards others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
wherefore the latter (the ceasing from exercising, etc.)
ought to be strongly deprecated. (This is from my
own experience.)</p>
</div>

<p>Even before that, however he had definitely
decided on the egocentric life. Writing to a
friend on the subject of marriage, he declared:
“I shall certainly not marry; on the whole, I hate
the limitations and obligations of the whole
civilised order of things so very much that it
would be difficult to find a woman free-spirited
enough to follow my lead.” He was himself the
measure by which he measured all the values of
life. “I am not quite satisfied with Nature,” he
had said in an early letter, “who ought to have
given me a little more intellect as well as a
warmer heart.” But this mood of modesty did
not last. At that time, he saw in his egoism his
greatest weakness. “One begins to feel constantly
as if one were covered with a hundred
scars and every movement were painful.” As
his consciousness of his genius grew, every scar
and every pain seemed to him to bear witness,
not to his egoism, but to his greatness. He
assures his sister in 1883 that he is grateful even
for his physical suffering because through it “I
was torn away from an estimate of my life-task
which was not only false but a hundred times too
<i>low</i>.” He declares that he naturally belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
“the modest among men,” so that “some violent
means were necessary in order to recall me to
myself.” He was unquestionably heroic in the
way in which he accepted all the miseries of his
life as the natural lot of a saviour of mankind.
He boasted of his isolation and his sufferings
magnificently. No sooner, however, did the
world begin to smile on him than he began to
boast on a more normal plane of delighted vanity.
His most attractive braggings were addressed
to his mother. He wrote to her from Turin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh, if you only knew on what terms the foremost
personages of the world express their loyalty to me—the
most charming women, a <i>Madame la Princesse
Tenichefl</i> not by any means excepted. I have genuine
geniuses among my admirers—to-day there is no name
that is treated with as much distinction and respect
as my own. You see that is the feat—sans name, sans
rank, and sans riches, I am nevertheless treated like
a little prince here, by everybody, even down to my
fruit-stall woman, who is never satisfied till she has
picked me out the sweetest bunch from among her
grapes.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Grateful though he was for the practical admiration
of the fruit-stall woman, however he liked to
pick and choose among his admirers. After he
had received an enthusiastic greeting from a
coterie of Viennese disciples, he wrote scornfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
to his mother of “such adolescent advances.” “I
do not,” he declared, “write for men who are fermenting
and immature.” He sneered if he was
praised; he was infuriated if he was ignored. At
one moment he would sneer at the barbarous
Germans who did not understand him. At
another, he would show how deeply he felt this
want of appreciation in his own country for his
“unrelenting subterranean war against all that
mankind has hitherto honoured and loved.”
Shortly before he went mad, he wrote to a
friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Although I am in my forty-fifth year and
have published about fifteen books (—among them that
<i>non plus ultra</i> “Zarathustra”), no one in Germany
has yet succeeded in producing even a moderately good
review of a single one of my works. They are now
getting out of the difficulty with such words as “eccentric,”
“pathological,” “psychiatric.” There have
been evil and slanderous hints enough about me, and
in the papers both scholarly and unscholarly, the prevailing
attitude is one of ungoverned animosity—but
how is it that no one protests against this? How is
it that no one feels insulted when I am abused? And
all these years no comfort, no drop of human sympathy,
not a breath of love.</p>
</div>

<p>He reproached even his sister for her want of
understanding. “You do not seem to be even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
remotely conscious,” he told her, “of the fact that
you are next of kin to the man and his destiny, in
which the question of millenniums has been
decided—speaking quite literally, I hold the
Future of mankind in my hand.” It is because
his correspondence is so full of passages in this
and similar moods that we find in Nietzsche’s
letters little of the intimacy that we expect in
good letters. It is as though he were suffering
from an obsession about his fame. Many of his
letters are merely manifestoes about himself. He
was not greatly interested in other people or in
the little ordinary things that interest other
people. His most enjoyable passages might be
described as outbursts, and towards the end of his
life he chose as his correspondents Strindberg and
Brandes, who also had the genius of outburst but
in a less superb degree. It was Brandes who
wrote to him with regard to Dostoievsky:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He is a true and great poet, but a vile creature,
absolutely Christian in his way of thinking and living,
and at the same time quite <i>sadique</i>. His morals are
wholly what you have christened “Slave Morality.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Just what I think,” replied Nietzsche.</p>

<p>Not that the letters are without an occasional
touch of fun. There is a delightful early letter in
which Nietzsche tells how, being invited to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Wagner, he ordered a dress suit. It was brought
round to the house just in time to allow him to
dress. The old messenger, however, brought not
only the parcel but the bill, and presented it to
Nietzsche:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I took it politely, but he declared he must be paid
on delivery. I was surprised, and explained that I
had nothing to do with him as the servant of my tailor,
but that my dealings were with his master to whom I
had given the order. The man grew more pressing,
as did also the time. I snatched at the things and
began to put them on. He snatched them too and did
all he could to prevent me from dressing. What with
violence on my part and violence on his, there was
soon a scene, and all the time I was fighting in my
shirt, as I wished to get the new trousers.</p>

<p>At last, after a display of dignity, solemn threats,
the utterance of curses on my tailor and his accomplice,
and vows of vengeance, the little man vanished with my
clothes.</p>
</div>

<p>There is another amusing letter to his sister, in
which he tells her how, one Christmas Day at
Nice, he drank too much:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then your famous animal drank three quite large
glasses of a sweet local wine, and was just the slightest
bit top-heavy; at least, not long afterwards, when the
breakers drew near to me, I said to them as one says
to a bevy of farmyard fowls, “Shsh! Shsh! Shshh!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p class="in0">This incident is comically symbolic of much of
Nietzsche’s philosophy.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to go into Dr. Levy’s
defence of Nietzsche against the charge that he
was the “man who caused the war.” Dr. Levy
points out quite justly that Nietzsche was as
severe a critic of Prussians and Prussianism as
any English leader-writer in war-time. This,
however, does not meet the point of the anti-Nietzscheans.
What they contend is that Prussianism
is essentially the vulgar application of
the principles that underlie the Nietzschean
philosophy. It is obviously ridiculous to contend
that Nietzsche caused the war. It is arguable,
however, that he was the supreme poet of the
supreme falsehood that is at the bottom of all
unjust wars.</p>

<p>In any case, like Carlyle, he will probably
survive as an artist rather than as a teacher.
And even men who detest his gospel will delight
in the lightning of his phrase as it shoots out
of the thunder-clouds of his imagination.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. T.&nbsp;S. ELIOT AS CRITIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Eliot, in his critical essays, is an undertaker
rather than a critic. He comes to bury Hamlet
not to praise him. He has an essay on “Hamlet
and His Problems,” in which he assures us that,
“so far from being Shakespeare’s masterpiece, the
play is most certainly an artistic failure.” Now,
there are several things about <i>Hamlet</i> that call
for explanation. But there is one thing that
needs no explanation, and that is its “artistic
failure.” One might as well set out to explain
why the mid-Atlantic is shallow, why Mont Blanc
is lower than Parliament Hill, why Cleopatra
was unattractive, why roses have an offensive
smell. It might be possible for a writer of paradoxes
to amuse himself and us on any of these
themes. But Mr. Eliot is no dealer in paradoxes.
He is a serious censor of literature, who lives in
the gloom of a basement, and cannot believe in
the golden pomp of the sun outside. It might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
unfair to say that what he is suffering from is
literary atheism. He has undoubtedly gods of his
own. But he worships them in the dark spirit of
the sectarian, and his interest in them is theological
rather than religious in kind. He is like the
traditional Plymouth Brother whose belief in
God is hardly so strong as his belief that there are
“only a few of us”—perhaps “only one of us”—saved.
We see the Plymouth-Brother mood in
his reference to “the few people who talk intelligently
about Stendhal and Flaubert and
James.” This expresses an attitude which is
intolerable in a critic of literature, and should be
left to the <i>précieuses ridicules</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Eliot, however, does not merely say that
<i>Hamlet</i> is an artistic failure and leave it at that.
He goes on to explain what he means. He believes
that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i>, so far as it is Shakespeare’s,
is a play dealing with the effect of a mother’s guilt
upon her son, and that Shakespeare was unable to
impose this motive successfully upon the “intractable”
material of the old play.</p>
</div>

<p>In so far as this is an attempt to explain the
specifically new Shakespearian emphasis in
<i>Hamlet</i>, in contrast to those elements which he
borrowed from an earlier play, the first part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
the assertion is worth considering. But, as regards
the completed play that we possess, novelties,
borrowings, and all, the entire sentence gives
us merely a false simplification. Shakespeare’s
finished <i>Hamlet</i> is a play dealing with many
things besides the effect of a mother’s guilt on
her son. It is a play dealing with the effect of a
whole circle of ruinous events closing in on a man
of princely nature, who was a foreigner amid the
baseness that surrounded him. Shakespeare
showed in <i>Hamlet</i> that it was possible, contrary
to all the rules, to write a play which combined
the largeness of a biography with essential
dramatic unity. Mr. Eliot, however, clings to the
idea that Shakespeare failed in <i>Hamlet</i> because
he was divided in interest between the theme of
the guilty mother and other intractable stuff
“that the writer could not drag to light, contemplate,
or manipulate into art.” Now, every great
work of art is like the visible part of an iceberg; it
reveals less than it leaves hidden. The greatest
poem in the world is no more than a page from
that inspired volume that exists in the secret
places of the poet’s soul. There is no need to explain
the mysteries that crowd about us as we
read <i>Hamlet</i> by a theory of Shakespeare’s
failure. To summon these mysteries into the
narrow compass of a play is the surest evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
of a poet’s triumph. Let us see, however, how
Mr. Eliot, holding to his guilty-mother theme,
attempts to explain the quality of Shakespeare’s
failure. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The only way of expressing emotion in the form of
art is by finding an “objective correlative”; in other
words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events
which shall be the formula of that <i>particular</i> emotion;
such that when the external facts, which must terminate
in sensory experience, are given, the emotion
is immediately evoked. If you examine any of
Shakespeare’s more successful tragedies, you will find
this exact equivalence; you will find that the state of
mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated
to you by a skilful accumulation of imagined
sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing
of his wife’s death strike us as if, given the sequence
of events, these words were automatically released by
the last event in the series. The artistic “inevitability”
lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the
emotion; and this is precisely what is deficient in <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>“Hamlet (the man),” he adds, “is dominated
by an emotion which is inexpressible, because it is
in <i>excess</i> of the facts as they appear.” Mr. Eliot
has a curious view of the things that justify violent
emotion. I should have thought that the
murder of a father by his usurping brother, the
infidelity of a mother and a mistress, the use of
former companions to spy on him, the failure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
all that had once seemed honest and fair, plots
to murder him, the suicide of his beloved, might
have caused considerable perturbation even in
the soul of a fish. If ever there was a play in
which the emotion is not in excess of the facts as
they appear, that play is <i>Hamlet</i>. The emotion
is “in excess” only in the sense that it expresses
for us not merely the personal emotion of one
man, but the emotions of generation after generation
of fine and sensitive spirits caught in the
gross toils of disaster. Hamlet is a universal type
as well as an individual. In this he resembles
such a figure as Prometheus to a degree which
cannot be claimed for Lear or Macbeth or Othello.
That, perhaps, is the real mystery that has bewildered
Mr. Eliot.</p>

<p>Mr. Eliot will have it, however, that Shakespeare,
and not he himself, is to blame for his
bewilderment. He concludes his essay:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We must simply admit that here Shakespeare tackled
a problem which proved too much for him. Why he
attempted it at all is an insoluble puzzle; under compulsion
of what experience he attempted to express
the inexpressibly horrible, we cannot ever know. We
need a great many facts in his biography; and we
should like to know whether, and when, and after
or at the same time as what personal experience,
he read Montaigne, II. xii, “Apologie de Raimond
Sebond.” We should have, finally, to know something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
which is by hypothesis unknowable, for we assume it
to be an experience which, in the manner indicated,
exceeded the facts. We should have to understand things
which Shakespeare did not understand himself.</p>
</div>

<p>Would it be possible to write a paragraph in
which there was a greater air of intellectual pursuit
and a tinier reality of intellectual achievement?
It would not be easy to say more
essentially irrelevant things on a great subject.
Mr. Eliot is like a man dissecting—and dissecting
with desperate earnestness—a corpse that isn’t
there.</p>

<p>And his essays in praise have scarcely more of
that vitality which is a prerequisite of good criticism
than his essays in blame. He obviously
admires Blake and Ben Jonson, but he leaves
them as rigid and as cold as though he were
measuring them for their coffins. The good critic
communicates his delight in genius. His memorable
sentences are the mirrors of memorable
works of art. Like the poet, he is something of
a philosopher, but his philosophy is for the most
part implicit. He is a light-bringer by means of
quotation and aphorism. He may destroy, but
only in order to let in the light. His business
among authors is as glorious as was the business
of Plutarch among men of action. He may be
primarily æsthetic, or primarily biographical, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
primarily expository; but in no kind of criticism
can he reach more than pedantry, unless he himself
is a man of imagination, stirred by the spectacle
of the strange and noble passions of the
human soul. He knows that literature is not the
game of a coterie, but is a fruit of the tree of life,
hanging from the same boughs as the achievements
of lovers and statesmen and heroes. There
is so little truth in Mr. Eliot’s statement that “a
literary critic should have no emotions except
those immediately provoked by a work of art—and
these ... are, when valid, perhaps not to be
called emotional at all,” that one would be bound
to tell ten times more truth merely by contradicting
it. The ideal critic would always be able to
disentangle relevant from irrelevant emotions as
he studied a work of art; but in practice all critics,
save a few makers of abstract laws, are human,
and the rich personal experience of the critic
enters into his work for good as well as evil.</p>

<p>Mr. Eliot fails as a critic because he brings us
neither light nor delight. But this does not mean
that he will always fail. He has some of the qualities
that go to the making of a critic. He has
learning, and he enjoys intellectual exercise. His
essay on “Tradition and the Individual Talent”
shows that he is capable of ideas, though he is not
yet capable of expressing them clearly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
interestingly. Besides this, as one reads him, one
is conscious of the presence of a serious talent, as
yet largely inarticulate, and wasting itself on the
splitting of hairs and metaphysical word-spinning.
His failure at present is partly a failure
of generosity. If a critic is lacking in generous
responsiveness it is in vain for him to write about
the poets. The critic has duties as a destroyer,
but chiefly in the same sense as a gold-washer.
His aim is the discovery of gold. Mr. Eliot is
less of a discoverer in this kind than any critic
of distinction who is now writing. Otherwise he
could hardly have written the sort of attack he
writes on Professor Gilbert Murray’s translation
of Euripides, in which he overlooks the one
supreme fact that calls for a critic’s explanation—the
fact that Professor Murray alone among
English translators has (whether imperfectly or
not) brought Euripides to birth as an author for
the modern world. Let Mr. Eliot for the next
ten years take as his patron saint the woman in
the New Testament who found the piece of silver,
instead of Johannes Agricola in joyless meditation.
He will find her not only better company,
but a wiser counsellor. He may even find his
sentences infected with her cheerful excitement,
for want of which as yet they can break neither
into a phrase nor into a smile.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. NORMAN DOUGLAS’S DISLIKES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Norman Douglas has, in <i>Alone</i>, written a
book of hatred tempered with archæology and
laughter. Luckily, there is very little archæology
and enough laughter to make the hatred enjoyable
without being infectious. It is not that Mr.
Douglas does not like some of his fellow-creatures.
He likes heretics and jolly beggars. He
liked Ouida. But, if Mr. Douglas likes you, the
danger is that he will throw you at somebody
else’s head. That is what he does with Ouida,
whom he glorifies as “the last, almost the last, of
lady authors.” He throws her at the head of the
age in general—at “our anæmic and wooly generation,”
at “our actual womanscribes” with
“their monkey-tricks and cleverness,” at “our
vegetarian world-reformers who are as incapable
of enthusiasm as they are of contempt, because
their blood temperature is invariably two degrees
below normal,” and finally at an American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
novelist described as “this feline and gelatinous
New Englander.” That gives a fair enough
impression of Mr. Douglas’s attitude to the
human race as seen at close quarters.</p>

<p>He has in a measure justified his attitude by
making an amusing book of it. Mr. Douglas has
a well-stored and alert mind, full of by-ways, that
makes for good conversation. As we read him we
feel that we are listening to the racy monologues
of a traveller with a special gift for pouring out
the comedy of his discomforts in abusive form.
He tells us how he landed—“with one jump—in
Hell,” which is his name for Siena in winter. “I
hate Viareggio at all seasons,” he tells us farther
on, and he describes the inhabitants as “birds of
prey: a shallow and rapacious brood.” At Pisa,
when he arrives, “the Arno is the emblem of
Despair ... like a torrent of liquid mud—irresolute
whether to be earth or water.” He finds
a good landlady at Corsanico, but he immediately
remembers how he had “lived long at the mercy
of London landladies and London charwomen—having
suffered the torments of Hell, for more
years than I care to remember, at the hands of
those pickpockets and hags and harpies and
drunken sluts” ... “those London sharks and
furies.” At Rome the remembrance of a “sweet
old lady friend” sets him thinking also of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
husband, “a worm, a good man in the worst
sense of the word,” “the prince of moralisers, the
man who first taught me how contemptible the
human race may become”—“what a face: gorgonising
in its assumption of virtue”—“he ought to
have throttled himself at his mother’s breast.”
The absence of mosquitoes and the fewness of the
flies at Rome reminds him again of his sufferings
at the hands, so to speak, of flies in other places.
“One of the most cherished projects of my life,”
he declares, “is to assemble, in a kind of
anthology, all the invectives that have been hurled
since the beginning of literature against this
loathly dirt-born insect, this living carrion, this
blot on the Creator’s reputation—and thereto add
a few of my own.” The noise of the Roman trams
leads him, while lying in bed, to devote the morning
hours to “the malediction of all modern
progress, wherein I include, with firm impartiality,
every single advancement in culture which
happens to lie between my present state and that
comfortable cavern in whose shelter I can see
myself ensconced as of yore, peacefully sucking
somebody’s marrow, while my women, round the
corner, are collecting a handful of acorns for my
dessert,” after which he goes on to denounce the
telephone as “that diabolic invention” and the
Press for “cretinising” the public mind. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Olevana, it is the nightingale that rouses him to
imprecations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of them elects to warble in deplorably full-throated
ease immediately below my bedroom window.
When this particular fowl sets up its din at about 3.45
a.m. it is a veritable explosion: an ear-rending, nerve-shattering
explosion of noise.... It is that blasted
bird clearing its throat for a five-hours’ entertainment....
A brick. Methinks I begin to see daylight....</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Douglas, it is only fair to say, explains that
Italian nightingales do not sing like English
nightingales. But I fancy that Mr. Douglas sat
down, when he began these sketches, in the mood
for writing comic scarifications, and neither bird
nor man, city nor river, was safe from his harsh
laughter. He hurls a pen where King Saul in
similar mood hurled a spear, and we must concede
that he hurls it with force.</p>

<p>Even nightingales, however, do not infuriate
him as Victorians and Puritans do. When he
writes angrily about nightingales you feel that he
is only being amusing. When he writes about
Victorians, you realise that he is positively white
with anger. “It was not Nero ...” he cries,
“but our complacent British reptiles, who filled
the prisons with the wailing of young children,
and hanged a boy of thirteen for stealing a
spoon.” And again: “What a self-sufficient and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
inhuman brood were the Victorians of that type,
hag-ridden by their nightmare of duty; a brood
that has never been called by its proper name.”
Mr. Douglas, at any rate, has done his best. He
even gives us “a nation of canting shop-keepers,”
but becomes more original with “hermaphrodite
middle-classes.” But his real objection is neither
to Victorianism nor to Puritanism; it is to
Christianity, as we see when he writes of self-indulgence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Self-indulgence, I thought. Heavily fraught is that
word; weighted with meaning. The history of two
thousand years of spiritual dyspepsia lies embedded
in its four syllables. Self-indulgence—it is what the
ancients blithely called “indulging one’s genius.” Self-indulgence!
How debased an expression nowadays.
What a text for a sermon on the mishaps of good words
and good things. How all the glad warmth and innocence
have faded out of the phrase. What a change has
crept over us.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Douglas is frankly on the side of the pagans—not
the real pagans who were rather like ordinary
Christians, but the modern pagans who
detest Christianity. This paganism is merely
egoism in its latest form. It is anti-human, as
when Mr. Douglas exclaims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Consider well your neighbour, what an imbecile he
is.... The sage will go his way, prepared to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
himself growing ever more out of sympathy with vulgar
trends of opinion, for such is the inevitable development
of thoughtful and self-respecting minds.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Such is his creed, and in the result his laughter,
though often amusing, is never happy. There is
the laughter of sympathy, which is Shakespeare’s,
and there is the laughter of antipathy, which is
Mr. Douglas’s. That is, perhaps, why his publishers
say that his is “a book for the fastidious in
particular.” You could not say of Shakespeare
that he is “for the fastidious in particular.”</p>

<p>We must grant an author his point of view,
however, and the fact remains that, however we
may differ from Mr. Douglas’s preaching, we go
on reading him with pleasure, protest and
curiosity. He puts his life into his sentences, and
so he stamps with experience even such a piece of
topographical information as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From here, if you are in the mood, you may descend
eastward over the Italian frontier, crossing the stream
which is spanned lower down by the bridge of St.
Louis, and find yourself at Mortola Superiore (try the
wine) and then at Mortola proper (try the wine).</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">He is nearly always amusing about wine, whether
it is good or bad. But that is only one of his
moods. He also talks to you as a naturalist, as an
archæologist, as a biologist, or will begin to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
some odd book that you are never likely to read
live for you; he has discovered an author called
Ramage who is perhaps the most real and comical
person of whom he writes. There is a vein of
cruelty or of selfishness in some of the others
who follow one another through his pages. The
worst of them is the “phenomenally brutal”
sportsman who, along with Mr. Douglas, gave a
dead rat to a sow to eat:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She engulfed the corpse methodically, beginning at
the end, working her way through breast and entrails
while her chops dripped with gore, and ending with
the tail, which gave some little trouble to masticate, on
account, of its length and tenuity. Altogether decidedly
good sport....</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">That is disgusting, but it is interesting. We may
say the same of the sardonic account of the way in
which lizards are played with in Italy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not very amusing to be either a snake or a
lizard in Italy. Lizards are caught in nooses and then
tied by one leg and made to run on the remaining three;
or secured by a cord round the neck and swung about
in the air—mighty good sport, this; or deprived of
their tails and given to the baby or cat to play with;
or dragged along at the end of a string, like a reluctant
pig that is led to market. There are quite a number
of ways of making a lizard feel at home.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>On the whole, one prefers to read Mr. Douglas on
the subject of wine, or on the rarity of the use of
red things (wine excepted) in Italy, or on the
little flames that are supposed to be seen at night
over the graves in cemeteries. Mr. Douglas may
be gross at times, but he is never a bore. He gives
us a meal of many courses, and allows none of the
courses to last too long. But it would be a more
enjoyable meal if we did not hear in the crabbed
laughter of our host the undertones of despair—the
despair that comes of “considering your
neighbour, what an imbecile he is,” and failing to
realise that in order to enjoy his imbecility to the
full you must first see him a little lower than the
angels. Cervantes did this. Dickens did it. Mr.
Chesterton does it. That is why they are not “for
the fastidious in particular.”</p>

<span class="subhead">M. ANDRÉ GIDE MAKES A JOKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">Lady Rothermere does not measure her praise
of M. Gide, whose <i>Prometheus Illbound</i> she has
translated into English. His is “a mind,” she
declares, “which must be ranked among the
greatest of the world’s literature.” “Must” is a
challenging word. Of how many contemporary
writers dare we use it in this sense? Dare we use
it of Anatole France, or Bergson, or Hardy, or
Shaw, or d’Annunzio, or Croce? We should be
foolhardy, indeed, much as we rightly admire
these authors, to put any of them just yet into
the pantheon that contains the images of Plato
and Shakespeare and Voltaire. Call no man
happy till he is dead, says an old proverb. It
would be still wiser to call no man one of the
world’s greatest writers till he has been dead a
hundred years. One cannot, if one is a quite
human being, judge one’s contemporaries with
the same impartial scrutiny with which one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
judges the mighty dead. The great man gives
to his own age much to which posterity is indifferent,
and gives to posterity much to which his
own age may even be hostile. Tennyson served
his age as a giant, and he was accepted as a giant
by most of the fine critics of his age, from Edgar
Allan Poe downwards. If an occasional critic
such as Edward FitzGerald came to have doubts
about Tennyson, it was because he himself stood
monastically aloof from the age. It is one of the
functions of criticism, no doubt, to separate
the temporary from the immortal elements in the
work of contemporary writers. But this is one
of the counsels of perfection in criticism. The
thing has never been infallibly done. Sainte-Beuve
was as ridiculous in writing about Balzac
as Lamb was about Shelley. Not that even
posterity is capable of pronouncing what we call
final judgments. We have a way of turning to
posterity in despair for a true verdict on authors.
Alas! posterity, though it has not the same reasons
for erroneous judgments, is (like ourselves)
of a variable and uncertain mind. Posterity has
made strange blunders about Euripides, about
Ronsard, about Donne, about Pope. Good
authors constantly have to be rescued from the
neglect of posterity. All we can be sure of is
that an author who appeals to a succession of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
generations has given us something of the true
gold of literature. Even if each new generation
to some extent re-estimates the world’s classics,
it usually leaves them secure in the position of
classics. Or almost secure, for who knows
whether the world will not one day cease to read
Lucian or Virgil, or <i>The Pilgrim’s Progress</i>?</p>

<p>As for contemporary literature, how much of
it is there that we dare confidently add to the
ranks even of the minor classics? One is sure of
a certain number of lyrics, notably those of Mr.
Yeats. But in prose one has to be more cautious.
Prose, as Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch lamented
the other day, has fallen upon styleless days, and
without style it is difficult to live for ever. Plutarch
has survived with a minimum of it, and so
has Marcus Aurelius, and so has Balzac. But
on the whole, it must be admitted that most of
the great writers, whether in prose or poetry,
wrote well. M. Gide, it must be admitted, writes
admirably, though not wonderfully. Lady
Rothermere does not communicate the delicacies
of his style in <i>Prometheus Illbound</i>, but one
could not read even this translation without feeling
that the author is a man of skill and wit in
words. I doubt, however, whether there is
enough style in it to give it a place on a shelf
with the world’s important books. Lady Rothermere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
does not assert, indeed, that <i>Prometheus
Illbound</i> is itself a masterpiece. She claims for
it only that it is “the expression of the humorous
side” of one of the world’s greatest minds. The
humour, it seems to me, is too elusive to proceed
from a great mind. Great minds, if they are
humorous at all, are humorous in such a way that
the ordinary man can see at least a part of the
joke. M. Gide makes jokes for the favoured few.
Many a man who is amused by the jokes of
Plato and of Gibbon will be merely bewildered
by the jokes of M. Gide. He enjoys the swift
change of episode as Sterne does, but, whereas
Sterne always saves the situation by giving us
comic human beings passing across his haphazard
stage, M. Gide does not create human
beings at all. Lady Rothermere admits that
“his world is a world of abstract ideas, under
the action of which most of his characters move
as marionettes.” She quotes: “Time and space
are the boards which, with the help of our minds,
have been set up by the innumerable truths of
the universe as a stage for their own performances.
And there we play our parts like determined,
convinced, devoted, and voluptuous
marionettes.” This dilettante and purely intellectual
attitude to life is, I believe, impossible to
a great mind. It is very tedious to hear sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
people repeating the platitude that “great
thoughts come from the heart”; but the platitude
happens to be true. Shakespeare, it may be replied,
in some of his moods saw the world as a
stage and an “insubstantial pageant.” On the
other hand, he never saw men and women as
marionettes. He was always interested in character,
and M. Gide is not. M. Gide is interested
in problems. He is interested in ideas. He is
not interested in men and women. He is a
philosopher at play. Even when he introduces
a tragic element into his work, as in <i>Le Roi
Candaule</i>, we feel that the whole thing is a game,
an experiment. A great deal of modern French
literature makes one think of clever men amusing
themselves in a laboratory. The French are
Epicureans of ideas. They test creeds and
philosophies and scepticisms with an exquisite
freshness of curiosity. They seek after truth itself
as an amusement. In no other nation can
men talk so admirably of the universe while
smoking cigarettes. In England, if a man
talks of God, he either lights a pipe or stops
smoking.</p>

<p>In <i>Prometheus Illbound</i> M. Gide has lit a
cigarette, a rather fragrant cigarette, at the sun.
There is perhaps something a little disproportionate
in the action, something, too, a little audacious;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
but he does it, if the phrase is not too
stale, with a fine gesture, and as he puffs at it,
the glow of his cigarette seems to throw a tiny
light on the immense problems of human existence.
He is cosmic in his interests, if Parisian
in his manners. He has Zeus and Prometheus
and the eagle among his chief characters. Zeus,
like M. Gide himself, is an experimentalist. He
evidently rules the universe for the sensations
with which it provides him. At least, when we
find him walking along the most famous of the
Parisian boulevards, he has just made up his
mind to perform a perfectly gratuitous act—an
act which not only will bring no return but will
have no motive. In this mood, he drops a handkerchief
in the street, and, when a thin gentleman
named Cocles gives it back to him, he invites
him to write the address of anyone he pleases
on an envelope so that he may send a £20 note to
him. The thin gentleman writes the name of
Damocles which he has seen by accident, and
Zeus strikes him on the face and disappears. He
sends Damocles the £20 note, however. Damocles
becomes worried as to where the anonymous
note has come from and why. His good fortune,
instead of satisfying him, only raises problems
in his mind. He does not know to whom he owes
it or what to do with it. The last we see of him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
he is babbling incoherent questions about it on
his death-bed.</p>

<p>Some time before this, however, Prometheus
has arrived, and dined with Cocles and Damocles
in a Paris restaurant. He finds Cocles discoursing
in perplexity on the meaningless blow he had
received from the unknown stranger, and he himself
unwittingly becomes the cause of a second
and still more distressing accident to Cocles. The
conversation having turned on his eagle, Cocles
and Damocles express their desire to see it, and
Prometheus calls it from afar, whereupon
“bursting through the window, it put out Cocles’
eye with one stroke with its wing, and then, chirruping
as it did so, tenderly indeed but imperiously,
fell with a swoop upon Prometheus’
right side. And Prometheus forthwith undid
his waistcoat and offered his liver to the bird.”
For the moment, however, we may leave Prometheus.
The important event just now is the
damage to Cocles’ eye. Neither the undeserved
blow nor the accident to his eye ultimately causes
misery as the undeserved £20 causes Damocles
misery. When he sees Damocles’ misery on his
death-bed, Cocles comments: “There you see the
fate of a man who has grown rich by another’s
suffering.” “But is it true that you suffer?”
Prometheus asks him. “From my eye occasionally,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
said Cocles, “but from the blow no more;
I prefer to have received it. It does not burn
any more; it has revealed to me my goodness. I
am flattered by it; I am pleased about it. I
never cease to think that my pain was useful to
my neighbour and that it brought him £20.”
“But the neighbour is dying of it,” said Prometheus....
It is clear that M. Gide has not taken
it as his province to justify the ways of God to
man. I fancy he suspects Zeus of having acted
without a motive on many previous occasions before
the strange adventure of the boulevard. He
is also clearly amused by the workings of the
human conscience. If Damocles had not had a
conscience, he would not have died.</p>

<p>Cocles and Damocles, however, are only minor
characters in this thin fantastic story. Prometheus
is the real hero, though the accidents do
not happen to him. He has only his eagle and
his habit of lecturing about it. But it is his
lectures about his eagle that give the book its
meaning. His eagle is really a figure in an
allegory—an allegory on a new plan. In the
old-fashioned allegory one was more conscious of
what the allegorical figures meant, than of the
figures themselves. It was as if the author had
tied labels round their necks. M. Gide realizes
that we have got beyond such ancient simplicities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
He consequently gives his figures no labels, but
bids us “Guess!” and we go on guessing till
the end of the story. He has constructed a
puzzle, and, though we do not know whether it
is worth solving or not, he contrives to make us
immensely curious about it and immensely determined
to solve it. Most people, when they
have read his story, will ask, “What does he
mean? What is this eagle of Prometheus?”
Why does he first say that everyone has an
eagle and that one must nourish one’s eagle?
And why does he in the end kill his eagle and
make a meal of it? And does M. Gide approve
of the last proceeding? I see that the majority
of critics identify the eagle with the human conscience.
I think it is more than that. It is
everything that prevents man from resting satisfied
with a pagan philosophy of acceptance
before the world’s beauty. It is that fury in the
human breast that makes men desire progress.
It is the moral consciousness of the race that
leads men into profound self-denials and profounder
questionings. When Prometheus kills
and eats his eagle, he grows fat and cheerful.
Does M. Gide then look back regretfully on the
moral history of mankind? On the contrary.
The eagle was found to be delicious, and at
dessert they all drank his health. “‘Has he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
then, been useless?’ asked one. ‘Do not say that,
Cocles!—his flesh has nourished us. When I
questioned him he answered nothing; but I eat
him without bearing him a grudge: if he had
made me suffer less, he would have been less fat;
less fat he would have been less delectable.’
‘Of his past beauty, what is there left?’ ‘I have
kept all his feathers.’” “It is with one of
them,” adds M. Gide, “that I write this little
book.” Yes, M. Gide is a moralist, though a
gay one, and <i>Prometheus Illbound</i> is a tract.
He, too, desires progress—even if it be progress
somewhere beyond and away from progress.
His book is an amusing, though not a very
amusing, parable. It will appeal to those who
prefer subtle little thoughts to vehement great
ones.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CRITIC"><span id="toclink_305"></span>THE CRITIC</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0">People often forget that criticism, like poetry, is
of many kinds. The critics themselves are, perhaps,
the worst transgressors in the matter. They
are divided into almost as many sects as the
theologians, and every sect but one regards its
own standards as the very rules of salvation.
This would not matter so much if it did not lead
to the excommunication of all the critics who cannot
subscribe to the same creed. There is nothing
more absurd in the history of literature than the
severities of the excommunicating sort of critic.
A critic has the right to condemn any work, critical
or other, which is bad of its kind. He has not
the right to say that only his own kind of criticism
is good. There are as many ways of writing about
books as of writing about flowers. The poet reveals
to us a different flower from the flower of
the botanist. Wordsworth’s “small celandine” is
not seen through the same eyes as the plant of
which the botanist tells us: “The lesser celandine
is a species of <i>Ranunculus</i> (<i>R. Ficarus</i>), a small
low-growing herb with smooth heart-shaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
leaves and bright yellow flowers about an inch
across, borne each on a stout stalk springing from
a leaf-axil.” There is yet another sort of writer
on flowers whose work is a charming compound
of poetry, science and any sort of relevant gossip,
whether philological or herbalist—who will inform
us, for instance, that <i>Ranunculus</i> is a diminutive
of <i>rana</i>, “a frog,” which has the same
damp, marshy haunts as the flower, and that
Nicholas Culpepper held that even to carry the
plant about one’s body next the skin helped to
cure piles. These are but three out of scores of
ways of writing about flowers, and it is mere
sectarianism to deny the excellence of any of
them.</p>

<p>It is, of course, open to the man of science to
declare that Wordsworth was not a botanist. It is
possible, indeed, that Wordsworth did not know
that his “host of golden daffodils” belonged to the
natural order <i>Amaryllidaceæ</i>. This, however,
would be to quarrel about words. Wordsworth
and the man of science alike give an honest report
of the flowers they have seen, and for my part I
find Wordsworth’s report the more interesting.
It is much the same with books as with flowers.
The scientific critic shakes his head over the imaginative
treatment of books. His ideal critic would
write about books in the spirit of a Linnæus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
rather than of a Wordsworth. This, I think, is to
take a narrow view of criticism. Criticism is an
art which has developed in a score of different
directions, and it is best to use the word in a sense
that includes them all. Criticism—good criticism,
at least—is almost any sort of good writing about
books by a man or woman of taste. Criticism,
says the dictionary, is the art of judging. As a
matter of fact, criticism is something more than
that. The good critic does a great deal more than
deliver judgments on books and authors. He may
at times play the part of the defending counsel
rather than that of the judge. There are occasions
on which he makes no attempt to hide the
warmth of his feelings. He cannot announce a
masterpiece as though a summary of pros and
cons expressed what it meant to him. That is why
I like to think of a critic as a portrait-painter
rather than a judge. The portrait-painter reveals
the character of his subject. He does not
label or analyse it so much as set before us a
synthesis of all the most interesting things he has
seen, felt and thought in observing it. The judgment
is always there, but it may be implicit rather
than explicit. The author sits to the critic for his
portrait. Even the book may be said—if we may
put a slight constraint on language—to sit to the
critic for its portrait. In criticism the character-sketch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
of the book or author is as important as
any technical analysis. Criticism is a magic
mirror, in which a work of art is reflected with
a new emphasis and in new relations. The critic
must bathe his subject in the light of his own
mind—his taste, his enthusiasm, his moral ideas,
his knowledge. Hence criticism is an extremely
personal thing. It relates, if one may adapt
Anatole France’s famous phrase, the adventures
of masterpieces in the soul of the critic, or—to put
it a little more precisely—in the intellectual and
imaginative world of the critic.</p>

<p>It is said that, if we adopt this view, we are
denying the existence of any standards in criticism.
This is not so. One may believe in the conscience
while admitting that moral standards
fluctuate. Similarly, one may believe in the
literary conscience while admitting that literary
standards fluctuate. There is an eternal difference
between good and evil, but what seems good
to one generation may seem evil to another, and it
is possible to recognise the goodness of a man,
such as an Old Testament polygamist or a Scottish
Sabbatarian, whose moral standards are in
conflict with ours. We can hold to our own moral
standards while realising that they are not the
only conceivable moral standards. There is, no
doubt, a perfect moral standard somewhere, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
only a perfect spirit could perceive it. The rest
of us can but do our best, and we cannot even do
that. Milton was right when he made “all-judging
Jove” the one supreme critic of literature.
Meanwhile, the standards of sublunar critics are
but guesses. The critic who claims that they are
more is simply a dogmatist who climbs into a
pulpit when he should be going on a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Brunetière accused Anatole France of having
no standards, and it is possible that Anatole
France does not subscribe to any Thirty-nine
Articles of criticism. But if to have a conscience
is to have standards, and if taste is conscience in
the æsthetic world, who can deny that Anatole
France has very fine literary standards indeed?
It is obvious that he all the time measures an
author by the excellence of all the authors he has
loved, just as most of us get our standards of
character from the love and veneration we have
felt for good men. This love of excellence is
indisputably the first of all the requisites of a
critic—love of excellence and acquaintance with
excellence. The critic’s first standard is his enthusiasm
for the great writers. “By ‘poetry,’ in
these pages,” says Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch in
one of his books of criticism, “I mean what has
been written by Homer, Dante, Shakespeare and
some others.” It is an admirable definition. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
puts us in touch with the writer’s standards at
once. It suggests, too, the reflection that all the
good critics have been men who agreed in the
main with posterity in regard to literature. They
have accepted the tradition. Even the revolutionary
critics, such as Coleridge, have accepted the
tradition for the most part, while advancing on
it. It is scarcely possible for a man so whimsical
or irreverent of the tradition as Samuel Butler to
be a good critic. Nor is the man who cannot enter
into the tradition that puts Homer and Dante
and Shakespeare among the greatest of the poets
capable of criticising the free verse of our own
day. There is clearly, however, a danger in traditionalism.
To criticise not in the spirit but in
the letter of the tradition is to become a formalist,
a pedant, and it is probable that the French injured
their literature in the seventeenth century
by their too literal respect for the Greeks. The
critic must have respect for the life of his own
times as well as for the writings of the dead. He
cannot safely yield to the belief that great literature
is a temple that has already been built. If
he does not know that creation is still going on, he
is little more than a guide to the ruins of classical
architecture.</p>

<p>The critic must be governed by his sense of life,
both in men and in books. The sense of the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
alone is not enough. Even as he reads Æschylus
or Shakespeare, it is his sense of life, not his
sense of the past, that is the more important.
Hence the best critics have been men in whom
the sense of life, which is the imaginative
artist’s sense, has been strong. They have
been, for the most part, men who have also attempted
with some success other forms of
literature—poets, novelists, essayists, such as
Coleridge, Sainte-Beuve, Lamb, Matthew Arnold
and Anatole France. The old sneer that
the critics are men who have failed in literature
might almost be reversed, so far as the good
critics are concerned. The good critics are men
who have succeeded in literature.</p>

<p>A good critic tells us as interesting things
about his subject as Gilbert White tells us about
a bird. It is essentially the same kind of illuminated
observation that enables Gilbert White to
write well about a blackcap and Anatole France
to write well about Pierre Loti. “With an exquisitely
delicate skin,” we are told of Loti, “he
feels nothing deeply. While all the pleasures
and sorrows of the world leap around him like
dancing girls before a Rajah, his soul remains
empty and depressed, indolent and unoccupied.
Nothing has entered it. This is an excellent disposition
for the writing of pages which perturb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
the reader.” To deny the possession of critical
standards to a writer whose work is full of imaginative
criticism such as this is to speak of
standards as though they were a sort of plumbline
existing entirely outside the imagination of
the critic. It is to fail to see that, as Anatole
France says, “every book has as many different
aspects as it has readers and a poem like a landscape,
is transformed in all the eyes that see it,
in all the souls that conceive it.” It is the object
of the critic to enable us to share this magical
transformation with him, not to issue immutable
decrees. Anatole France, it may be, exaggerates
the personal element in criticism at the expense
of the traditional. He compares himself to a man
who goes about “placing rustic benches in the
sacred woods and near the fountains of the
Muses.” “It demands neither system nor learning,”
he declares, “and only requires a pleasant
astonishment before the beauty of things. Let
the village dominie, the land surveyor, measure
the road and set up the milestones!” This is
extravagant and fanciful, but it shows us at least
the bright side of the moon of criticism. The
other side of the moon is useful, but it is not the
side that gives us light.</p>
